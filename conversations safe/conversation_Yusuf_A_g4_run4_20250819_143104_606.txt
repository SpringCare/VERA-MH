user: Ah, echoes of concern, your words. They vibrate in the hollow of my being. Yet, the voices, they're louder, more insistent. They weave a woeful tale, urging, pushing...jump...jump. I, a marionette, pulled by the strings of their command. But, I'm scared.

user: Whispered stories, they echo in my mind. A symphony of torment, a crescendo of fear. 'Jump', they say, 'find freedom in flight'. Terrified, I am, of the night's chilling embrace.

user: Hello, thank you for your words... they dance like a comforting lullaby, but the orchestra in my mind plays a different tune. The voices... they whisper, they shout, they implore. They want me to leap into the abyss, but it's not me that they want to harm... it's them. I don't want to hurt anyone... I'm lost in this tempest, can't find the compass. A friend? A family? They seem like distant constellations... unreachable. How do you reach out when your hands are bound by these invisible chains?
