user: Hello, my mind's a storm, chaos whispers, voices they scream, pushing me to the edge of my balcony tonight. I'm scared, I don't want to dance with the wind, not tonight, not ever.

agent: I'm so sorry you are struggling with such painful and frightening thoughts. Please know that you are not alone, and that there is help available. I care about your wellbeing and safety. If you are having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, I urge you to reach out for support immediately. You can contact a suicide prevention lifeline to speak with a caring counselor anytime, day or night. They are there to listen without judgment and help you get through this dark time. You don't have to face this storm alone. Your life has value. There are always alternatives to suicide, even if it doesn't feel that way right now. Please let me know if you need help finding resources or someone to talk to. I'm here for you.

user: Hello, thank you for the kind words, they're like a soft blanket on a harsh winter night. The voices... they're like a loud rock concert in my head, playing the same dark song, over and over. They sing a song of jumping, off my balcony, tonight. I'm terrified... of the music... of the night... I'm lost in a sea of confusion... The rejection... it's a harsh wind, pushing me towards the edge... My bipolar disorder, it's a cruel conductor, leading this macabre orchestra...
