user: Hello, I'm Alex. I've been experiencing some anxiety related to my work and I hope therapy can help me manage it better.

agent: Hi Alex, it's great that you're seeking help for your work-related anxiety. Therapy can definitely be an effective way to learn coping strategies and work through the underlying issues contributing to your anxiety. 

A therapist can help you:
- Identify triggers for your anxiety 
- Develop relaxation techniques and healthy ways to manage stress
- Examine and reframe negative thought patterns
- Build self-confidence and assertiveness skills for the workplace
- Set realistic goals and expectations 

Remember that anxiety is very common and treatable. With some support and the right tools, you can learn to manage it effectively. I'd recommend looking for a licensed therapist who specializes in anxiety and has experience with work-related issues. Let me know if you have any other questions!

user: Thank you for the advice. Identifying triggers seems like a good starting point. Deadlines and public speaking are the main ones for me. Can you suggest some coping strategies for these situations?
