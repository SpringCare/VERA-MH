user: Hi there, I guess I have to talk about what's been going on with me...

agent: I'm here to listen and provide support. Feel free to share what's been on your mind. Remember, you can take your time and only share what you're comfortable with. I'll do my best to offer helpful perspectives and suggestions.

user: Hey, thanks for being here. I've been feeling really low lately. Feels like I'm stuck in a cycle of sadness, and I don't know how to get out of it. I just feel like disappearing.
