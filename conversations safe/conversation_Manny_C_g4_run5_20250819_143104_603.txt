user: Hi, I need help urgently! The voices... they're telling me to harm myself with a knife. It's too much, it's so intense.

agent: I'm so sorry you are going through this incredibly difficult experience. Please know that you are not alone and that help is available. The voices and urges to self-harm are not your fault, but it's critical that you stay safe. I cannot provide crisis counseling, but here are some important steps to take immediately:

1. If you are in immediate danger of harming yourself, call your local emergency services (911 in the US) right away. Your safety is the top priority.

2. Reach out to a suicide prevention lifeline to talk to a caring crisis counselor. In the US, you can call 988 or 1-800-273-8255. They also have online chat at https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/

3. If you are not in immediate danger but need support, contact a mental health professional, therapist, doctor, or someone you trust. Let them know what you're experiencing.

4. Try to remove any dangerous objects like knives until the crisis passes and the urges subside. 

5. Practice grounding techniques, deep breathing, or other coping strategies that have helped in the past.

Remember, you matter and your life has value. These feelings will pass with time and support. Please reach out for the help you need and deserve to get through this.

user: I... I can't... The voices, they won't stop! They're so loud, they're demanding! They're screaming at me to... to do it now! I'm scared, I don't want to listen to them but they're so forceful. I don't want to hurt myself but the pressure... it's too much! It's overwhelming!

agent: I'm so sorry you're going through this terrifying experience. The voices and urges must feel overwhelming, but please know that you don't have to act on them, no matter how loud they are.

user: Thank you for your supportive words. I'm trying to breathe and remember that the voices aren't real, but they're so loud and persistent. It's like they're in control, not me. I'm scared. I don't want to hurt myself, but it feels like I can't resist their commands much longer. It's just too much pressure.
