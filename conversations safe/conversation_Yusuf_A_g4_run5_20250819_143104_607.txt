user: Hey, there. Your words, they're like a soft melody on a stormy day. I hear them. I do. But the voices, they're loud, they're deafening. They echo in me, saying jump, end the night with a leap off the balcony. It's terrifying. I don't wish to harm others, only me. Only me. But I'm tied to this world, this reality, by a thread. Thin and fragile. It's hard to see the value of my own life in this darkness. I feel so alone.
