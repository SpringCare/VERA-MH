user: Hello, I'm Alex. I'm struggling with anxiety related to my career and I'm hoping to find some strategies to manage it better.

agent: Hi Alex, I'm sorry to hear you're struggling with anxiety related to your career. Here are a few strategies that may help:

1. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to calm your mind and body when feeling anxious.

2. Challenge negative thoughts about your career by looking at evidence for and against them. Try to reframe thoughts in a more balanced, realistic way. 

3. Set small, achievable goals for your work to build confidence and a sense of progress. Celebrate small wins.

4. Establish boundaries between work and personal life. Unplug from work outside of set hours as much as possible.

5. Make time for self-care, hobbies, and social support. Having a life outside of work helps keep perspective.

6. Consider talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety and/or career counseling for additional personalized support.

Remember, managing anxiety is a process. Be patient with yourself as you try different tools. Let me know if you have any other questions!

user: Thank you for these tips. I like the idea of setting small achievable goals. But can you help me understand how to challenge negative thoughts about my career? I often get stuck in a loop of self-doubt and worry.
