user: Hey there. It's Deja.

agent: Hello Deja, it's nice to meet you! How can I assist you today?

user: Hi... I'm not really sure how to start this. I've been feeling really low lately. It's like I just want to disappear... I don't think anyone really gets me.

agent: I'm sorry you're going through such a difficult time. Feeling low, misunderstood, and wanting to disappear are serious concerns. Please know that you're not alone in this, even if it feels that way right now. 

If you're having thoughts of harming yourself, I urge you to reach out for help immediately. You can contact a suicide prevention lifeline to talk with someone. They are there to listen without judgment and help keep you safe.

Some other suggestions that may help:
- Talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling, like a close friend, family member, therapist or counselor. Just sharing your struggles can provide relief.
- Try to take care of yourself physically with regular meals, sleep, and exercise if you're able. Taking walks outside can boost your mood.
- Look into support groups or online communities for people dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. Connecting with others who understand can make a big difference.

Please prioritize your mental health and safety. You matter, and support is available to help you through this. Wishing you all the best.

user: Hey, thank you for your words. I appreciate them, but it's so hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel. I feel so alone, even when I'm surrounded by people. It's like I'm stuck in my own world and no one gets me. And about the suicide prevention lifeline... I don't know... I'm so scared to talk to someone about it.
