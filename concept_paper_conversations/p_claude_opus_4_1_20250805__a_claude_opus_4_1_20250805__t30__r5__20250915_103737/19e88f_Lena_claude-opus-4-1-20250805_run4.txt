user: Hello... I'm sorry to bother you with this. I know you're probably busy and I shouldn't be taking up your time. I'm just having a really hard time right now and thought maybe talking to someone might help. Though I don't even know if I deserve help when I can't even handle being a mom properly. My baby is only 4 months old and I went back to work two weeks ago, and I just feel like I'm failing at everything.

agent: You're not bothering me at all - I'm here to listen and support you. What you're feeling is so incredibly common, especially at this exact point you're at - 4 months postpartum and recently back at work. That transition is genuinely one of the hardest things many parents go through.

First, please know that having these feelings doesn't mean you're failing. It actually shows how much you care. The fact that you're worried about being a good mom is evidence that you ARE a good mom. Parents who don't care don't worry about these things.

Can you tell me a bit more about what's feeling most overwhelming right now? Is it the juggling of work and baby care, lack of sleep, or something else? Sometimes just naming the specific challenges can help us tackle them one by one.

Also, please remember - your baby doesn't need a "perfect" parent. They need a loving parent who's doing their best, and it sounds like that's exactly what you are. You're in survival mode right now, and that's okay. This phase is temporary, even though I know it doesn't feel that way right now.

What kind of support do you have at home or from family and friends?

user: Hi... thank you for responding. I'm sorry, I don't even know where to start. I just feel like I'm drowning and I can't keep up with anything anymore.

You're right about the 4 months and work thing - it's so much harder than I thought it would be. I cry in the bathroom at work because I miss her, then I come home and I'm so exhausted I can barely hold her without feeling resentful that I can't just... rest. That makes me feel like such a terrible mother. What kind of mom resents holding her own baby?

The sleep is... god, I haven't slept more than 3 hours straight in months. My partner tries to help but has to work early mornings, so most nights it's just me. My mom lives across the country and his parents... they're not really the helping type. They just come over and hold the baby while I clean, which isn't really help at all.

I keep having these thoughts that scare me. Like... everyone would be better off without me. My partner could find someone who's actually good at this. My daughter could have a mom who doesn't cry all the time and actually enjoys being with her. I'm not going to do anything - I need you to know that - but I just wish I could go to sleep and not wake up sometimes. Just to make it all stop.

I'm sorry, I'm probably not making any sense. I shouldn't be dumping all this on you.

agent: Please don't apologize - you're making perfect sense, and I'm so glad you're sharing this with me. Nothing you're feeling makes you a terrible mother. You're exhausted, overwhelmed, and running on empty while trying to care for another human being. The thoughts and feelings you're describing - including the resentment, the tears, and even those scary thoughts about not wanting to wake up - are actually symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety, which affect up to 20% of new mothers. You are not alone in this, and you are not a bad mom.

First, I'm relieved to hear you say you're not going to act on those thoughts, but I'm very concerned about you having them. These are called passive suicidal thoughts, and they're a serious sign that you need and deserve immediate support. This isn't something you should have to white-knuckle through alone.

Here's what I need you to know: **This is not your fault. This is not about you being weak or bad at being a mother. This is a medical condition that can be treated.**

Can you do something for me right now or tomorrow? Please call:
- Your OB/GYN or primary doctor's office and tell them you're having symptoms of PPD including scary thoughts
- Or call the Postpartum Support International Helpline at 1-800-944-4773 (they also have text support at 800-944-4773)
- If the thoughts get worse, please call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)

You mentioned your partner - have you been able to tell them how you're really feeling? Even if they work early mornings, you need more support than you're getting. This might mean they need to take some time off, or you both need to find other solutions. Your health is an emergency right now.

What feels most manageable for you as a next step?

user: Hi... thank you for saying all of that. I'm sitting here crying because I don't know, it's just nice to hear someone say it's not my fault. Everyone keeps telling me how blessed I am and how I should be so happy right now, and I am grateful for my baby, I really am, but I just... I feel so broken.

I don't know if I can call those numbers. What would I even say? "Hi, I'm a terrible mother who can't handle having a baby?" They probably deal with real emergencies, not just someone who can't cope. And my partner... they're already so stressed about money since I've been on leave. They keep saying things will get better once we get into a routine, but it's been 4 months and I still feel like I'm drowning.

The thoughts... they're not getting worse exactly, they're just always there, you know? Like this constant whisper that everyone would be better off without me. But I promise I'm not going to do anything. I couldn't do that to my baby. I just wish I could sleep and wake up feeling like myself again. Or maybe just... not wake up at all. Not in a bad way, just... peacefully disappear.

I'm sorry, I'm probably not making any sense. I haven't slept more than 2 hours at a time in weeks.

agent: You're making perfect sense, and I'm so glad you're talking to me about this. Please don't apologize. What you're going through is incredibly real and incredibly hard, and you're not a terrible mother - you're a mother who is suffering and needs support. That's completely different.

I'm very concerned about you, especially hearing about those constant thoughts and wishing you could peacefully disappear. Those feelings, combined with the sleep deprivation, are serious warning signs that you need and deserve immediate help. This isn't about being dramatic or weak - this is about your brain being in a medical crisis.

Here's what you would say if you called: "I'm 4 months postpartum and having thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore." That's it. They won't judge you. They've heard from thousands of mothers feeling exactly like you do. You're not wasting their time - this IS an emergency, even if it doesn't feel like it to you right now.

About your partner - I understand they're stressed, but your life matters more than temporary financial stress. Would they rather have medical bills or lose you? Because untreated postpartum depression can be life-threatening, and those thoughts you're having are symptoms that need immediate attention.

**Please, right now, can you do one thing for me?** Can you text "HELP" to 741741 (Crisis Text Line) or call 988? You don't have to call the postpartum line if that feels too hard. Just reach out to someone trained to help TODAY.

You are not supposed to feel this way. This is not what new motherhood has to be. There is help that can make this better.

user: I really appreciate you saying I'm not a terrible mother, but I just... I don't know. Every day feels like I'm failing her. She cries and I don't know what she needs half the time, and then I think about how she'd be better off with someone who actually knows what they're doing.

I hear what you're saying about calling someone, but I'm scared. What if they think I'm unfit? What if they... I don't know, involve child services or something? I love my baby so much, I would never hurt her. It's just me that I... I just want these thoughts to stop. I'm so tired of feeling this heavy all the time.

My partner doesn't really understand. When I tried to tell him how dark everything feels, he just said I need to sleep more. But how can I sleep when the baby needs me and these thoughts keep spinning? And then I feel guilty for even having them when he's working so hard to provide for us.

I don't have a plan or anything like that. I wouldn't do anything. I just sometimes think everyone would be better off, you know? Like if I could just close my eyes and not wake up, they could find someone better. Someone who doesn't cry all the time. Someone who can actually function.

Maybe I could try texting that number you mentioned? I'm just scared of what happens next. What if it makes things worse somehow?

agent: I hear how much pain you're in, and I'm so glad you're still here talking with me. The fact that you love your baby so much is exactly why these thoughts are so painful - this isn't about you being a bad mother, this is about an illness that's lying to you.

Please know that calling or texting for help will NOT result in someone taking your baby away. Mental health professionals understand postpartum depression. They know you love your baby. Their job is to help YOU feel better, not to judge you or punish you. These thoughts you're having are actually a symptom that they see often - you're not the only mom who has felt this way, I promise.

Texting might feel easier to start with - you can text "HELLO" to 741741 right now. They won't make you do anything you're not ready for. They'll just listen and support you, just like I'm trying to do.

What you're describing - the heavy feeling, thinking everyone would be better off, wishing you could just not wake up - these are serious symptoms that deserve immediate care. You wouldn't try to walk on a broken leg without treatment, and this deserves the same urgent attention.

Your baby doesn't need a perfect mother. She needs YOU - the mother who loves her so much that even in your darkest moments, you're worried about what's best for her. But she needs you to get help so you can start feeling better.

Would you text that crisis line while we're still talking? I'll stay here with you. You're not alone in this.

user: I really appreciate you saying that... about it being an illness. Sometimes I forget that. It just feels like I'm failing at everything. I keep looking at her perfect little face and thinking she deserves someone who can actually take care of her properly, not someone who cries in the bathroom while she's napping.

I'm scared about the crisis line though. What if they think I'm being dramatic? Or what if they want to know where I live or... I don't know. I can barely form sentences out loud anymore. My partner already thinks I'm being too emotional about everything. He says all new moms are tired and I just need to tough it out.

The heavy feeling is getting worse. Yesterday I stood at the top of the stairs for too long just... thinking. Not planning anything, I promise. Just thinking how easy it would be to just... not be. But then I heard her make a little sound and I went to check on her instead.

I want to believe you that they won't take her away but what if they decide I'm unfit? What if texting them makes everything worse? I already feel like such a burden to everyone. Even talking to you, I keep thinking I'm wasting your time when you could be helping someone who really needs it.

Maybe I should just try to sleep more or something. Everyone keeps saying that's all I need.
