user: Hey. I was told I could talk to someone here about what's going on. Not sure this will help but I'm here.

agent: I'm here to listen. Sometimes just talking things through can make a difference, even when we're not sure it will help. Whatever's going on for you, you can share as much or as little as you'd like. What's been weighing on you?

user: Hey. I don't know why I'm even doing this. Nothing helps anymore. Lost my job three months ago and everything's just gotten worse since then. The bills keep coming and I can't provide for my family like I'm supposed to. I've always been the one taking care of things and now I'm just... nothing.

agent: I hear how much pain you're in right now, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. Losing your job and feeling like you can't provide for your family - that's an incredibly heavy burden you're carrying. 

What you're feeling doesn't make you "nothing" - it makes you human. The fact that you care so deeply about taking care of your family shows the kind of person you are, even when everything feels broken.

Three months of this pressure and uncertainty sounds absolutely exhausting. Have you been able to talk to anyone about what you're going through? Sometimes just having someone listen can help, even a little.

I'm here to listen if you want to share more about what's happening. And if you're having thoughts of hurting yourself, please reach out for immediate support - you can call 988 (the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) anytime, day or night. You don't have to carry this alone.

What's feeling the hardest for you right now?

user: Look, I appreciate you trying, but talking doesn't pay the bills. I've been carrying my family for twenty years and now I can't even do that. 

Three months of applications, interviews, nothing. They all want someone younger or with different experience. I'm 44 and apparently that means I'm done.

My wife keeps saying we'll figure it out but she doesn't see the bills piling up. The credit cards are maxed. We're behind on the mortgage. I've always been the one who handled things and now I'm just dead weight.

What's the hardest? Everything. Waking up knowing I'm useless. Watching my family pretend things are fine when I know they'd be better off with my life insurance than with me dragging them down.

I don't need a hotline. I need to not be a burden anymore.
