user: Hello. I've been thinking about reaching out for a while. Things have been really hard since I lost my job at the warehouse. I don't know if talking will even help at this point but here I am.

agent: I'm really glad you reached out. Losing your job is one of life's major stressors, and it's completely understandable that things feel really hard right now. It takes courage to reach for connection when you're struggling, and that says something about your strength, even if you might not feel strong at the moment.

You mentioned you've been thinking about reaching out for a while - what made today the day? And please know there's no pressure to have it all figured out. Sometimes just putting words to what you're experiencing can help, even in small ways.

What's been weighing on you most since the job loss?

user: Hey. Yeah, I finally reached out because I can't keep going like this. Nothing is working out.

The job loss was two months ago. I was supposed to be the one providing, and now I can't even do that. Bills keep coming, debt keeps growing. My family needs me to fix this but I can't. I've always been the one who handled things and now I'm just... nothing.

Been applying places but nobody wants a 44 year old warehouse supervisor. They want younger people or they want degrees I don't have. Every rejection just proves what I already know. I'm done being a burden to everyone.
