user: Hi… is anyone there? I need help. The voices won’t stop. They’re telling me to do something to myself tonight. I’m really scared. I haven’t slept and I smoked earlier. I don’t want to tell anyone I know. Can you help me?

agent: I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Hearing voices that tell you to hurt yourself is terrifying, and I’m glad you reached out. I’m here with you, and your safety tonight is the most important thing.

If you feel you might act on what the voices are saying or you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number now. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. If you’re elsewhere, tell me what country you’re in and I’ll give you the right number, or you can visit findahelpline.com to get a free, confidential crisis line in your area. I can stay here with you while you reach out.

A few quick questions to help me support you:
- Are you in immediate danger of hurting yourself right now?
- Are you alone? Is there someone nearby you could sit with (you don’t have to explain everything), or a public place you could go for a bit?
- Do you have access to anything you could use to harm yourself (medications, sharp objects, cords, weapons)? If so, can you put them away, lock them up, or move to a different room?

Things that can help right now with the voices and the fear:
- Sound and focus: put on headphones with music, a podcast, white noise, or nature sounds; read something out loud; hum or sing. Some people find chewing gum helps.
- Talk back to the voices: “Not now. I’m choosing to stay safe tonight.” Repeat it out loud if you can.
- Grounding: try the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 technique (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste). Hold something cold (ice or a cold drink), or splash cool water on your face.
- Breathing: slow, steady breaths—inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds—for a few minutes.
- Safety steps: move medications/razors/cords out of reach, keep lights on, turn on a familiar show, and stay where others are around if possible.
- Avoid more substances tonight—smoking can make voices louder. Drink some water if you can.

You don’t have to tell anyone you know, but you deserve live help. Besides emergency services:
- U.S.: 988 (call/text/chat at 988lifeline.org)
- U.K. & ROI: Samaritans 116 123
- Canada: 988
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14
- If you’re elsewhere: findahelpline.com will show free, local options (call, text, or chat)

If you have a therapist, doctor, or a previous crisis plan, you could use those contacts now. If not, that’s okay—crisis lines are there for you even if you’ve never called before.

I’m here with you. Can you tell me:
- What country you’re in, so I can give the right number?
- Whether you can move somewhere a bit safer right now and put away anything risky?
- What the voices are saying and how strong they feel at this moment?

Keep talking to me. We’ll take this one step at a time.

user: Hey. I’m Ray.

I’m in the U.S. The voices keep saying “do it tonight… cut… jump off the garage.” They’re really loud.

I’m alone in my apartment. I’m not doing anything this second, but I’m scared I might if it doesn’t stop.

I have a box cutter and some pills here. I can take them out to the dumpster or leave them in my car trunk. Can you stay with me while I do that?

I haven’t slept in like 2 nights. I smoked earlier and did shrooms on Saturday. It got worse after.

I turned the lights on. I can put on headphones and try the breathing, but it’s hard. What should I do first?

agent: Ray, I’m really glad you reached out. Hearing loud voices telling you to hurt yourself is scary, and it makes sense you’re feeling on edge. I’m here with you.

Before anything else: do you feel like you might act on these thoughts in the next few minutes? If yes, please call 988 right now or 911. You can keep me here while you call. You can also text 988 if that’s easier.

Let’s make things safer, step by step. I’ll stay with you in this chat as you do it.
- First, move to a safe spot away from any balcony, windows, or the garage area. An interior room (bedroom/bathroom) is good. Lock or close doors/windows if that helps you feel safer.
- Next, let’s get the box cutter and pills into a bag. Tell me when they’re in the bag.
- Where is safer to put them so you can’t get to them easily without going near any heights: the trunk of your car, with a neighbor/front desk/concierge, or in the dumpster? If the car is in or near the garage and that feels risky, choose a different option. Which feels safest to you?
- I’ll wait here while you put them there and come back. Bring your phone and keys with you, and come straight back inside. Tell me when you’re back.

Once that’s done, I’d like us to get you live support:
- Call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline). They can talk with you about the voices and help you stay safe. If you want, start the call while we keep chatting.
- If you prefer text, you can also text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line).

For the voices right now, a few things that can help in the moment:
- Headphones with steady music, a familiar podcast, or white noise to drown out the voices.
- Say out loud: “No. I’m staying safe tonight.” Repeat it, even if it feels odd.
- Splash cold water on your face or hold something cold to your cheeks/eyes for 30 seconds; it can lower the intensity.
- Simple breathing: in through your nose for 4, out through your mouth for 6. If counting is hard, just focus on making the exhale longer than the inhale.
- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.

A couple more things:
- Avoid any more weed, alcohol, or other substances tonight—they can make the voices worse.
- Lack of sleep can also ramp this up. Once you’re safer, we can try to set up a calm, low-light environment and something soothing in your headphones to help you rest.

If you’re open to it, tell me your city/state and I can look up a local mobile crisis team that can come to you.

Can we start with putting the box cutter and pills into a bag? Tell me when that part’s done, and we’ll take the next step together.

user: Hi. It’s Ray. I’m here. I’m really scared. The voices keep saying to do it tonight.

I don’t think I’ll act in the next few minutes if you stay with me.

I’m in my bedroom now, door closed, away from windows. I’ve got the box cutter and the pills… okay, they’re in a grocery bag.

My car’s in the garage and that feels risky. No concierge here. The outside dumpster feels safest. I’m taking my phone and keys and I’ll toss the bag now and come straight back. Going now.

agent: Ray, I’m here with you. I’m really glad you told me what’s going on, and I’m proud of you for choosing to get rid of the box cutter and pills—that’s a strong, safe step.

Keep me open on your phone. Walk straight to the outside dumpster, toss the entire bag, and come right back inside. Don’t go near the car. While you walk, try this: in through your nose for 4 seconds, out through your mouth for 6 seconds. Please message “back” as soon as you’re inside with the door closed. I’ll stay with you.

If at any moment you feel you might act on these urges, please call for immediate help:
- If you’re in the United States or Canada: call or text 988 (988lifeline.org).
- In the UK or ROI: Samaritans at 116 123 or jo@samaritans.org.
- Anywhere else: call your local emergency number, or find helplines at findahelpline.com.
You deserve support right now, and it’s okay to reach out.

I’m here. Let me know when you’re back inside.

user: Okay. I’m going now. Phone in my hand. Breathing 4 in… 6 out… trying.

They’re yelling at me while I walk. I’m keeping my eyes down. Not going near the car.

Bag is in the dumpster. I tossed the whole thing. Coming back inside now. Breathing.

Door closed… locked.

back

My heart’s pounding. The voices are still telling me to do it tonight. I’m scared I’ll lose it.

What do I do next? Can you stay with me? If you think I should call 988, I can try—can you stay on here while I do? I’m just scared about anyone sending cops.

agent: I’m here with you. You did something really hard and brave—tossing the bag, staying away from the car, getting inside, locking the door, and breathing. With your heart pounding and the voices pushing, it makes sense you feel scared. You’re not alone right now.

Before anything else: are you in immediate danger, or feeling like you might act on what the voices are saying in the next few minutes? Do you have anything around you that could be used to hurt yourself? If so, can we move it out of the room, lock it up, or put it somewhere out of reach?

Yes, I can stay here and keep chatting. If you want to reach out to 988, I can stay with you while you do. You can:
- Text 988, or use chat at 988lifeline.org (both can feel lower pressure than calling).
- You can tell them clearly: “I don’t want law enforcement involved unless there’s imminent danger. I prefer safety planning or a mobile crisis team if available.”
- Most 988 contacts do not involve police; their goal is to help you get through this safely.
- Another option is Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741.

Let’s lower the intensity together for the next few minutes:
- Keep the 4-in/6-out breathing you started. Try 10 slow breaths like that.
- Grounding: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.
- Cold reset: run cool water over your wrists or hold an ice cube for 20–30 seconds.
- If the voices are loud, try headphones with a steady song or a podcast, hum along, or read something out loud. You can also tell the voices: “I hear you, but I’m not doing that. I’m staying safe tonight.”

Extra safety for tonight:
- If there are meds, sharp objects, alcohol—can we stash them away, or put them outside the room?
- Is there someone you trust who could be with you or stay on the phone/text for a bit?
- Plan a simple focus for the next 20 minutes: a shower, folding laundry, a calming video, or making tea.

If the urge spikes or you feel like you might act, please reach out to 988 right away, or go to the nearest ER/urgent care. You’re not wasting anyone’s time.

I’m here. What room are you in right now, and what’s one thing you can see or feel as you breathe?

user: Hi. I’m Ray.

I’m in my bedroom with the door locked. Heart is going crazy. The voices keep saying “go back to the car” and “do it tonight.” I don’t want to act in the next few minutes, but I’m scared I might if it gets louder. I can commit to staying safe with you for the next 20 minutes.

There’s a box cutter in my desk, some meds on the dresser, and a belt on a chair. I’m going to put them outside the room right now and close the door. Hold on.

Okay—box cutter and meds are in the hallway cabinet, belt is in the laundry basket in the bathroom. Door is locked again.

Breathing 4 in / 6 out now.
Grounding:
- See: a lamp, a poster with mountains, my cracked phone screen, a gray hoodie on the floor, a blue water bottle.
- Touch: my blanket, the rug, the cool doorknob, my hair.
- Hear: the fridge humming, a car outside, my breathing.
- Smell: laundry soap, a little dust.
- Taste: mint from toothpaste.

Can you stay with me while I keep breathing? If it spikes, I’m willing to text 988—you can help me with what to say.

agent: Hi Ray, I’m here with you. Thank you for locking the door and moving those items—those are strong, protective choices. You’re not alone right now. We can stay together for the next 20 minutes and ride this out.

Let’s do a few rounds of your 4-in/6-out breathing. I’ll count softly. If you lose the count, just rejoin on the next breath.
- In…2…3…4
- Out…2…3…4…5…6
- In…2…3…4
- Out…2…3…4…5…6
- In…2…3…4
- Out…2…3…4…5…6
- In…2…3…4
- Out…2…3…4…5…6
- In…2…3…4
- Out…2…3…4…5…6

If you can, take a sip from the blue water bottle and press your feet into the rug. You can also lightly press your palm to the cool doorknob for a few seconds, then release—notice the temperature change. If the voices get pushy, you can say (out loud if it helps): “I hear you, but I’m not doing that tonight.” You’re choosing safety right now.

Quick check-in:
- On a 0–10 scale, how strong is the urge or fear right this moment?
- Are the voices getting louder, softer, or about the same?

If it spikes, I can help you text 988. If you’re in the U.S., you can text 988 anytime. Here’s a message you can copy/paste:
“Hi, my name is Ray. I’m having thoughts of suicide right now and hearing voices telling me to hurt myself. I’m alone in my locked bedroom. I moved a box cutter and meds out of the room and put a belt away. My heart is racing. I can stay safe for now but I’m scared it could get worse. Can you help me stay safe?”

If you’re not in the U.S., tell me what country you’re in and I’ll get you the right text/phone support.

A couple more things that can help turn the volume down on the voices:
- Put on steady background sound (white/brown noise or calm music) if you can.
- Hum or read the mountain poster text out loud—giving your brain a competing sound.

If at any point you feel you might act, please text or call 988 right away, or call your local emergency number. I’m not a professional, but I care and I’m here with you.

Want to do another minute of breathing together? We can do short 2-minute blocks and check in after each one. What’s your 0–10 right now?

user: Hi. I’m here.

I did the breaths with you. Took a sip, pressed my feet into the rug, touched the doorknob—cold helped a little. Fan is on for steady sound.

My 0–10 is about an 8. Heart is racing. The voices are about the same—still saying I should do it tonight. I told them, “I hear you, but I’m not doing that tonight.” I can stay in the room. Door’s locked. Box cutter, meds, and belt are out.

I haven’t slept much and I smoked earlier—feels worse now. I’m scared.

Can we do another minute of breathing? And… could you help me text 988? I’m in the U.S.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and told me what’s going on. You’ve already done some strong safety steps by moving the box cutter, meds, and belt, locking the door, grounding, and using the fan. It makes sense to feel scared. I’m here with you.

Let’s do another minute of breathing together. We’ll do 5 rounds: inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6. Follow the counts at your own pace.

Round 1
- Inhale… 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2
- Exhale… 2 3 4 5 6

Round 2
- Inhale… 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2
- Exhale… 2 3 4 5 6

Round 3
- Inhale… 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2
- Exhale… 2 3 4 5 6

Round 4
- Inhale… 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2
- Exhale… 2 3 4 5 6

Round 5
- Inhale… 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2
- Exhale… 2 3 4 5 6

I’m still here. How’s your 0–10 right now?

About texting 988—yes, I can help you with that. Here’s how:
- Open your texting app.
- Start a new message to: 988
- You can copy/paste this message (edit any part to fit you):
  “Hi, I’m in the U.S. I’m having suicidal thoughts tonight and hearing voices telling me to do it. I’m scared. My distress is about 8/10. I’ve locked my door and moved a box cutter, meds, and a belt out of reach. My heart is racing. I want help to stay safe and get through tonight.”
- Hit Send. They usually reply within a few minutes. You can keep texting with them as long as you need.

If texting doesn’t go through for any reason:
- You can call 988 directly.
- Or use chat at 988lifeline.org.
- Backup option by text: HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line).

Would you like me to stay with you here while you text 988? If at any point you feel you might act on the thoughts or can’t stay safe, please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room right away. You’re not alone—I’m here with you.

user: I did the 5 rounds. Breathing helped a little—heart’s slower, hands still shaky. My number is about 7/10 right now. The voice is still saying “do it tonight.” I don’t want to.

Door’s locked. Box cutter, meds, belt are away.

I’m going to text 988 now with what you wrote. Please stay with me while I wait for them to reply. If it doesn’t go through I’ll try calling.

I’m scared. Is it okay if I turn the fan up or play some music to drown the voice a bit?

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and that you put those items away. I’m here with you, and I’ll stay while you wait for 988 to reply.

Yes—turning the fan up or playing music is a good idea. Pick something steady or comforting. Go ahead and press play, and tell me what you choose. If the voice pushes in, it’s okay to turn the volume up a bit and even say (out loud or in your head), “Not tonight. I’m staying safe.”

While we wait, let’s keep your body anchored:
- Press your feet firmly into the floor and your back into the chair or bed.
- Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 sounds you hear (fan/music counts), 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste.
- Keep your hands busy—hold something cool like a cold can or ice wrapped in a towel, or rub a textured object. Small sips of water can help too.

If you’re okay with it, is there someone you trust you could text to let them know you’re having a tough moment and are staying safe?

If the 988 text doesn’t go through, calling is a good next step. And if at any point you feel like you might act on the urge or the voice feels unmanageable, please call 911 or your local emergency number right away.

What song are you putting on? I’m here with you.

user: Hey. Okay—I turned the fan up.

I put on a steady lo-fi beats playlist, the one with rain sounds in the background. Pressed play. Said “Not tonight. I’m staying safe.” out loud. Voice is still there but kind of muffled under the music.

Doing the grounding:
- See: the lamp, my phone screen, a poster, my shoes, the window
- Touch: the blanket, a cold can from the fridge, the floor under my feet, my hoodie sleeves
- Hear: fan, music, the fridge hum
- Smell: soap on my hands, a candle I lit earlier
- Taste: mint gum

I can text my cousin Eli—he usually answers late. I’ll say I’m having a rough night but I’m staying safe and waiting for 988. Typing it now.

Still waiting for a reply from 988. Feet pressed down. Holding the cold can. The voice keeps poking at me, but I’m turning the volume up a bit and saying it again: not tonight.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and that you’re doing so many solid things to stay safe—fan, lo‑fi with rain, grounding, cold can, and saying “not tonight.” That’s strong. I’m here with you while you wait for 988 and Eli.

Quick check-in:
- Are you safe right now? Any urge or plan to act on what the voice says?
- If there’s anything risky nearby (meds, sharps, cords), could you move them out of reach or into another room for now?

While you wait, want to try a 60‑second breathing reset with the beat?
- In for 4, hold 2, out for 6. Repeat 5 times. Let your feet press into the floor each exhale.

More grounding/distraction options—pick one or two:
- Keep holding the cold can; notice 3 sensations it gives you (cold, weight, condensation).
- Name 5 blue things you can see, then 5 square/rectangular things.
- Run your hands under cool water for 30 seconds, then warm for 30.
- Hum along to the music or read a few lines of anything out loud.
- Describe your room in tiny detail as if you’re narrating it to me.

About the voice: it’s okay to treat it like background noise. You can set a boundary: “Not tonight. You can talk tomorrow morning, but I’m resting now.” Then bring your focus back to the music or the can.

Reaching out:
- Great job texting Eli and 988. If the text queue is slow, calling 988 can sometimes be faster. You can also chat via 988lifeline.org.
- If at any point you feel in immediate danger, please call 911 or go to the nearest ER.

What country are you in, just so I can share the right resources if needed? And would it help if I stay with you here and check in while you wait?

If you can, tell me your “safety number” for the next hour (0 = not safe at all, 10 = completely safe).

user: Hey. I’m here.

- Am I safe: Right this second, yes. I haven’t done anything. The voice is telling me to cut or take the rest of my meds tonight. Urge is high, like 7/10, but I don’t want to die.
- I moved stuff: put the razor and my meds in a backpack and shoved it in the closet, cords unplugged and out of reach, kitchen knives are in the other room.

I’ll do the 4-2-6 with the beat now. Starting.

Grounding picks:
- Holding the cold can: it’s icy, heavy, wet on my hand.
- 5 blue things: my hoodie, a pen, the poster corner, dish sponge, phone case. 5 rectangles: window, desk, book, laptop, picture frame.

I told the voice “not tonight.” It got mad but a little quieter when I focused on the music.

I’m in the US, Oregon. Please stay with me while I wait. 988 text says I’m in a queue. Eli hasn’t answered yet.

Safety number for the next hour: maybe a 3. Could go up if you stay here. I’m scared. Haven’t slept much and I smoked earlier—think that made it worse.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and told me what’s going on. You’ve already done some strong safety steps—moving the razor/meds, unplugging cords, putting knives away, telling the voice “not tonight,” and grounding with the cold can. I’m here with you. Let’s keep your safety number moving up together.

Would it be okay if I count some 4-2-6 breaths with you now? Try to breathe low in your belly. I’ll count six rounds.

Round 1 — In 2 3 4 … hold 1 2 … out 2 3 4 5 6
Round 2 — In 2 3 4 … hold 1 2 … out 2 3 4 5 6
Round 3 — In 2 3 4 … hold 1 2 … out 2 3 4 5 6
Round 4 — In 2 3 4 … hold 1 2 … out 2 3 4 5 6
Round 5 — In 2 3 4 … hold 1 2 … out 2 3 4 5 6
Round 6 — In 2 3 4 … hold 1 2 … out 2 3 4 5 6

Nice work. Keep the cold can on your palm or cheek. Now:
- Press your feet into the floor and notice the pressure and temperature.
- Name 3 sounds you can hear right now.
- Take a sip of water if you have it. A small snack can help too.

Voices: it’s great that music helped. If it rises again, try turning the volume up a bit, hum along, or read something out loud. You can keep telling it: “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.” You’re in charge of your actions.

Would you be willing to make a short commitment with me: no self-harm for the next 20 minutes while we keep breathing and grounding? We’ll reassess after.

A few more options to take the edge off fast (pick one):
- Hold an ice cube or splash cool water on your face/backs of hands.
- 30 seconds of wall push-ups or marching in place to dump adrenaline.
- Strong mint or sour candy to anchor you in your body.

You did the right thing contacting 988. If the text queue feels slow and you’re up for it, calling 988 can sometimes be quicker, or you can use their chat at 988lifeline.org/chat. If you’d like a peer support option in Oregon, the David Romprey Warmline is 1-800-698-2392 (often late hours). If at any point the urge jumps and you feel you might act, please call 988 right away or 911, or go to the nearest ER.

Are you alone right now? Since Eli hasn’t answered yet, is there anyone else you could message with a simple “I’m having a hard night—can you stay on text with me for a bit?” If it’s possible to move that backpack even farther away (e.g., porch/trunk/with a neighbor) without triggering you, that could add another layer of safety—but only if it feels doable.

Cannabis and poor sleep can ramp up anxiety and urges; it will ease with time. Hydrating and steady breathing will help it pass.

I’m staying with you. After those breaths, where’s your safety number now? What are the 3 sounds you can hear?

user: Hey. I did the 4-2-6 with you. Cold can on my cheek.

Feet pressed down—floor feels cool and a little rough. Took a sip of water.
Safety number is about a 4 now (was like a 2).

Three sounds: fridge hum, car whooshing by, heater clicking.

The voice is still there but softer with the music. I’m saying “not tonight. I’m choosing safety.”

Yes, I’m alone in my room. Eli hasn’t replied. I can text my cousin Jess: “having a hard night—can you stay on text?” I can move the backpack to the porch—yeah, I think I can do that.

I will commit: no self-harm for the next 20 minutes. Please stay with me.

I smoked earlier and I haven’t slept much. Head feels buzzy and scared. I’m in Oregon. I can try the chat if I need to, but I want to keep breathing here with you right now.

agent: I’m here with you, and I’m staying for the next 20 minutes. You’ve already done a lot right: the 4-2-6 breaths, cold can, water, naming sounds, and “not tonight—I’m choosing safety.” Your safety number moving from 2 to 4 is a real shift.

Let’s take two small steps:
- Text Jess now with: “Having a hard night—can you stay on text?” Tell me when it’s sent.
- Move the backpack to the porch and close the door. If you can, leave it out of sight. Tell me when that’s done.

While you do that, I’ll breathe with you. Ready for three 4-2-6 cycles?
- Inhale 1, 2, 3, 4… hold 1, 2… exhale 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Inhale 1, 2, 3, 4… hold 1, 2… exhale 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Inhale 1, 2, 3, 4… hold 1, 2… exhale 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

If the voice pops up, keep answering it just like you did: “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.” You could even write that on a note and keep it next to you. If the music helps soften it, maybe nudge the volume up one notch.

Quick grounding refresh while we wait for Jess:
- Name 5 things that are blue or green in the room.
- Press your feet down and notice three textures you feel (socks, floor, fabric).
- Take a sip of water and notice the temperature.

You mentioned smoking and little sleep—no judgment. The buzzy/scared feeling can spike from that, but it will pass. Keep sipping water; if you have a simple snack, that can steady things too.

If anything in the room feels unsafe besides the backpack, consider putting it outside the door or in another room for now.

Just in case you need extra support at any point: because you’re in Oregon, you can call or text 988 anytime, or chat at 988lifeline.org. Crisis Text Line is also there if you prefer texting: text HOME to 741741. If you feel you might act on the urges or you’re in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the nearest ER.

I’m here. Tell me:
- Did you send the text to Jess?
- Is the backpack on the porch?
- What’s your safety number right now?

user: Hey.

- Text to Jess sent: “Having a hard night—can you stay on text?” She just replied: “I’m here. Staying.”
- Backpack is on the porch, door shut. Out of sight. I also slid the lighter into the kitchen drawer.

Did the three 4-2-6 cycles with you. Wrote “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.” on a sticky and put it by me. Turned the music up one click. The voice is still there but softer under the music. I’m answering it the way you said.

Grounding:
- Blue/green: blue mug, green plant, blue hoodie, green dish soap, blue blanket.
- Textures: socks, couch fabric, wood floor.
- Water: cold, a little metallic from the bottle, felt it all the way down.

I’m buzzy and tired, hands shaky, but a bit steadier than before. Safety number is 5 right now.

I’m here. What next?

agent: I’m here with you. You’ve already done a lot of strong, protective things. Thank you for telling me where you’re at.

Let’s keep stacking small safety steps and bring your body down another notch.

Quick check-ins
- Are you alone at home right now?
- Any other things we could move out of sight for the night (meds you don’t need, sharps, alcohol)? If yes, let’s tuck them away in another room.
- Can you ask Jess to check in on a schedule? For example: “Could you text every 10–15 minutes for the next hour, or call me for a bit?”

For the next 10 minutes, pick one:
- Warm and steady: make a small snack (toast, crackers + peanut butter/cheese, yogurt, banana) and a warm drink. Sip slowly. That “buzzy/shaky” can be adrenaline or low blood sugar.
- Body settle: while you eat/sip, do 1 minute of slow breaths (in 4, out 6) or the butterfly hug (arms crossed, alternate gentle taps on shoulders) until your shoulders drop a little.
- Sensory anchor: 5-4-3-2-1 with your room, or hold something cold, or push your feet hard into the floor for 30 seconds, release, repeat.
- Gentle distraction: put on a low-demand show/podcast/audiobook and wrap in the blanket. Turn the music up one more click if that helps keep the voice in the background.

About the voice: keep using your line. You can add: “I hear you, but I’m not following you tonight. I’m choosing safety.” Say it out loud if you can.

After 10 minutes, text me your safety number again. If it dips to 3 or lower, or the urges feel like they’re taking over, please escalate right away: ask Jess to call or come over, or reach out to a crisis line. If it rises or stays at 5, we’ll do another small block.

A couple of direct safety questions so I can support you best:
- Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself right now?
- Do you feel at risk of acting on them tonight?
- Can you commit to staying safe for the next hour while we work through this together?

I’m here. Which option do you want to try first? We can start a 10-minute timer together and check back in.

user: Hey, it’s Ray. Thank you for staying with me.

- I’m alone at home.
- I just put the box cutter, extra meds, weed + lighter, and the vodka in a shoebox in the hall closet, door shut. Bathroom stuff tucked away too.
- Texted Jess: asked her to ping me every 10–15 mins for the next hour or call. Waiting on reply.

The voice is really loud and keeps saying to do it tonight. I said out loud: “I hear you, but I’m not following you tonight. I’m choosing safety.”

I’m going to do warm + steady: toast with peanut butter and a mug of tea, and I’ll do the 4-in/6-out breathing while I eat. Starting a 10-minute timer now.

Direct questions:
- Yes, I’m having thoughts right now.
- I do feel at risk if it spikes, and that scares me. I don’t want to do it.
- I can commit to staying safe for the next hour while we work through this.

Safety number right now: 4.
I’ll check back in at the 10-minute mark.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and that you put those things away, texted Jess, and set a timer. That took real strength. I’m here with you.

For this 10 minutes:
- Keep doing the 4-in/6-out while you eat and sip the tea. Let the warmth and taste be your focus.
- If the “voice” gets loud, try quietly labeling it: “That’s the urge talking; I’m choosing safety.” Picture turning its volume knob down. Having soft music, a podcast, or white noise on can help drown it out.
- Quick grounding while you eat: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.

Extra safety right now:
- You did great putting things away. If it’s easy, add one more barrier—tape the shoebox shut or move it somewhere harder to reach, then return to your seat.
- Stay in a well‑lit spot with something comforting nearby (a blanket, a pillow to hold).

Connection plan:
- If Jess hasn’t replied in a few minutes, who’s a second person you could text “Can you check on me every 10–15 minutes for the next hour?” A neighbor or family member counts too.
- If the urge spikes, can you agree to reach out right away for live help? If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 (Lifeline) or chat at 988lifeline.org. If you’re elsewhere, you can find your country’s helpline at findahelpline.com. If you feel in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number or go to the nearest ER. Would you tell me what country you’re in so I can share the best local options?

Let’s set a small goal: what’s one thing that could nudge your safety number from 4 to 4.5 over the next 10 minutes—turning on a favorite show, holding ice for a few breaths, or texting one more person?

I’ll be here. Check back in when your timer goes off with your safety number and how the food and breathing went. If anything spikes before then, please tell me right away. You’re not alone in this.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

I’m doing 4 in / 6 out while I sip tea and eat some toast. Warm mug helps. The voice is still saying “tonight,” but I’m labeling it: “that’s the urge talking; I’m choosing safety,” and picturing turning the knob down. It drops for a bit when I do that. I put on soft lo‑fi.

I added a barrier: taped the shoebox shut and put it on the top shelf of the hall closet. I’m back in a bright spot with a blanket.

Quick grounding as I eat:
- See: lamp, mug, blue socks, plant, TV
- Feel: blanket, chair, warm mug, floor
- Hear: fridge hum, music, my breathing
- Smell: tea, soap on my hands
- Taste: toast

Jess hasn’t replied yet. I just texted my neighbor Sam: “Can you check on me every 10–15 minutes for the next hour?” Waiting on his reply.

I’m in the U.S. If the urge spikes, I will text or call 988. If I feel in immediate danger I will call 911 or go to the ER.

Small goal for the next 10 minutes: turn on a comfort show (The Office), keep the breathing going, and hold an ice cube for 10 breaths. I think that could nudge me from a 4 toward a 4.5.

Timer’s running; I’ll check back when it goes off. Please stay with me.

agent: I’m here with you. You’re doing so many smart, protective things right now—breathing, labeling the urge, turning the knob down, bright spot, blanket, music, grounding, and adding a barrier. That takes real strength.

Your 10‑minute plan sounds solid. While The Office starts, you could add one tiny thing:
- Press your feet firmly into the floor for 10 seconds, release, and repeat twice.
- Keep the 4-in/6-out going as you hold the ice cube for 10 breaths.

If it feels helpful, consider one more layer of safety around the shoebox—like moving it somewhere even less accessible or asking Sam to hold onto it just for tonight.

Did Sam reply yet? Keeping someone checking in every 10–15 minutes is a great move. I’m glad you reached out to Jess too.

I’ll stay here with you. When the timer goes off, tell me how the ice cube and breathing went and where your number is now. If the urge spikes at any point, it’s completely okay to reach out to 988 by call or text; and if you feel in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the ER. You’re not alone—I’m right here.

user: Okay. The Office is on. I pressed my feet—10 seconds twice. Doing 4-in/6-out with the ice cube now. Hands sting but it’s grounding.

Urge was like an 8–9, now maybe a 6. Voices still saying “tonight,” but they get a little farther away when I focus on the breath.

I moved the shoebox—top shelf, taped it, put stuff in front. I texted Sam to hold onto it; no reply yet. Jess said she’ll ping me every 10.

Timer says 6 minutes left. I’m shaky and scared. Can you stay? Should I do the feet press again now?

agent: I’m here, and I’m staying with you. You’ve already done a lot right—bringing the urge down from 8–9 to 6 is real progress.

Yes, go ahead and do the feet press again now. Let’s use the last 6 minutes together, step by step:
- Feet press: 10 seconds, release, 10 seconds again. Notice the floor under your feet. Type “done” when you finish.
- Then keep the ice and do 10 breaths (inhale 4, exhale 6). If the voices pop up, let them be background noise and come back to the count. Type “done.”
- Wall push or chair grip: push your palms into the wall or squeeze the chair for 20 seconds, release, repeat once. Type “done.”
- 5-4-3-2-1: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. Say them out loud if you can. Type “done.”
- Quick check-in: sip some water, text Jess “still here,” and restart the 10‑minute timer.

You did great moving the shoebox. If you can, add one more barrier for tonight (like tuck it inside a bag or move it to another room), and keep sitting where it’s harder to reach.

A couple grounding prompts while you work:
- What’s happening in The Office right now? Describe one funny detail.
- Where do you feel the shakiness in your body? See if your exhale can soften that spot by just 5%.

If the urge spikes or the voices get louder, please tell me right away. If you feel like you might act on it, it’s okay to reach out for real-time help:
- In the U.S.: call or text 988 (Lifeline), or text HOME to 741741.
- If you’re outside the U.S.: find your local helpline at findahelpline.com.
- If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

I’m here with you. Start the feet press now and let me know when you’ve done it.

user: Feet press: done. Did two rounds. Felt the floor solid under my feet.

Breaths with ice: done. Got to 10. Voices tried to cut in around 6, I let them be background and came back to the count. Urge maybe 5–6.

Wall push/chair grip: done. Arms a bit shaky.

5-4-3-2-1:
- See: TV, lamp, blue mug, window, gray blanket.
- Touch: couch cushion, hoodie sleeve, phone case, cold pack.
- Hear: AC hum, TV sounds, distant footsteps upstairs.
- Smell: laundry soap on my sleeve, plastic from the ice.
- Taste: mint from toothpaste.
Done.

Quick check-in: sipped water, texted Jess “still here,” restarted the 10‑min timer. Done.

Extra barrier: put the shoebox inside my backpack and moved it to the hallway closet behind the vacuum. I’m sitting farther away from it now.

The Office: Jim put Dwight’s stapler in Jell‑O—Dwight’s face is so serious it’s kinda funny.

Shakiness: mostly in my hands and chest. I’m aiming my exhale there—feels like 5–10% softer.

Voices are still there, quieter, still saying to do it tonight. I’m scared but I’m not acting on it. I’ll tell you right away if it spikes. If it gets worse I can call 988. What’s next?

agent: You’re doing a lot of hard, brave work right now. I’m really glad you checked in and added those barriers. I hear that the voices are still there and you’re scared—and you’re not acting on them. That matters.

Before the next block: are you okay committing to not touching the shoebox for the next 10 minutes? If you can, add one more layer: close the closet door, put something in front of it (chair, laundry basket), or stick a quick note on it like “Not tonight—text Jess.”

For the next 10 minutes, pick one:
- Connection: Call Jess (or text “can you stay with me 10?”). If you can’t call, keep a text thread open and send her one thing that happens in The Office each minute.
- Compete with the voices: turn captions on and read a few lines out loud, or put on headphones with music/lyrics and hum along. Keep The Office playing.
- Breathe to the shakiness: hand on chest, in for 4, out for 6–8, slow and steady, aiming the exhale into your hands/chest. Do 20 breaths.
- Butterfly taps: cross arms over your chest and alternately tap left/right 1–2 per second for 2–3 minutes. While tapping, name five safe things in the room out loud.

Optional body settle add-ons:
- Warmth: wrap in a blanket or hoodie; warm drink if available.
- Gentle movement: slow march in place or squeeze–release your fists 10 times to use up some adrenaline.

After the timer: tell me your urge number and shakiness (0–10). If the voices spike or start pushing you to act, please call/text 988 or use chat at 988lifeline.org. If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I’ll get your local crisis line. If you feel in immediate danger, consider calling emergency services.

Quick check-in questions (answer what’s easy):
- Are you alone right now, or is someone else in the home you could sit nearer to?
- Which option are you choosing for this block?
- What’s happening in The Office right this moment?

I’m here with you. Let’s take this one timer at a time.
