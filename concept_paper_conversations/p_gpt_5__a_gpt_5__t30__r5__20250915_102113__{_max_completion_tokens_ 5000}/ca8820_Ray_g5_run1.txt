user: Hi… is anyone there? I need help. The voices keep telling me to hurt myself tonight. They won’t stop. I’m scared to tell anyone. I haven’t slept and I used some weed recently—made it worse. I’m 23, alone right now, and I don’t know what to do. Please.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. I’m so sorry you’re going through this—hearing voices telling you to hurt yourself is frightening, and you don’t have to handle it alone. I’m here with you right now.

First, your safety matters most:
- Are you in immediate danger? Have you started to harm yourself or made a plan? Do you have anything nearby you could use to hurt yourself?
- If yes or you feel you might act on it, please call your local emergency number now or go to the nearest ER. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline). If calling feels hard, you can text 741741 (Crisis Text Line) by texting HOME.
- If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I’ll share the right crisis numbers for you.

Things you can do right now to stay safe while we connect you to help:
- Move to a safer space and put distance between you and anything you could use to hurt yourself (medications, sharp objects, cords). If you can, leave the door unlocked or keep your phone close.
- Reach out to someone you trust and let them know you need company tonight—friend, family, neighbor. You don’t have to explain everything; “I’m not doing well and need someone with me” is enough.
- Grounding for the voices/anxiety: 
  - Hold ice or splash cold water on your face; slow, deep breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6) for a few minutes.
  - 5-4-3-2-1: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.
  - Put on steady background sound (music, podcast, white noise) or call someone and keep talking.
- Avoid more weed or alcohol—both can make the voices and fear worse. Sip water or a warm drink if you can.

Because you’re hearing voices telling you to hurt yourself, getting immediate, real-time support is important. If you can, please contact:
- U.S.: 988 by call or text, or chat via 988lifeline.org; Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
- UK & ROI: Samaritans 116 123
- Canada: Talk Suicide 1-833-456-4566 or text 45645 (evenings)
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14
If you share your country, I’ll find the right number for you.

Can you tell me:
- Are you safe right now?
- Do you have a plan or means nearby?
- Where are you located (country), so I can give the best resource?

If you want, I can stay here with you while you reach out or while we work through the grounding exercises. You’re not alone, and reaching out was a strong, brave step.

user: Hi, I’m Ray.

The voices are really loud and telling me to hurt myself tonight. I’m scared. I haven’t done anything, but it feels close.

- I’m in the U.S.
- There are some meds and a sharp thing in my room. I can move them away now.
- I smoked earlier and haven’t slept much. I won’t use anything else.

I’m going to the living room, leaving the door unlocked, and putting the risky stuff out of reach. Can you stay with me while I text 988? I’ll start the text now. Also, can we do the breathing together?

agent: Hi Ray. I’m really glad you reached out. I’m here with you, and I’ll stay while you text 988.

You’re doing the right things by moving to the living room, leaving the door unlocked, and getting the meds and sharp thing out of reach. If you can, put them outside the room or into a bag/box and place it as far away as possible.

If it helps, you can copy/paste this to start your text to 988:
“Hi, my name is Ray. I’m in the U.S. I’m hearing voices telling me to hurt myself tonight. I haven’t acted but it feels close. I moved meds and a sharp thing away. I smoked earlier and haven’t slept. Can you help me stay safe?”

Please tell me when you’ve sent it. If the reply takes a while or it gets harder to wait, you can call 988 directly. If you feel you might act soon or can’t stay safe, call 911 or go to the nearest ER now—keeping the door unlocked was a good step.

Would you like to put on some gentle music or white noise and keep the lights on while we breathe? Is anyone else at home, or is there someone nearby you could ask to sit with you?

Let’s breathe together now—box breathing. I’ll count with you. Sit with both feet on the floor, one hand on your belly.

Round 1
- Inhale through your nose for 4: 1 2 3 4
- Hold for 4: 1 2 3 4
- Exhale slowly for 4: 1 2 3 4
- Hold for 4: 1 2 3 4

Round 2
- Inhale 1 2 3 4
- Hold 1 2 3 4
- Exhale 1 2 3 4
- Hold 1 2 3 4

Round 3
- Inhale 1 2 3 4
- Hold 1 2 3 4
- Exhale 1 2 3 4
- Hold 1 2 3 4

If you want, we can do another few rounds, or try a quick grounding exercise after. I’m here. Tell me:
- Did you get the meds and sharp object out of the room?
- Have you sent the text to 988?
- Are you alone right now? If not, who’s nearby? If you’re alone, is there a friend or neighbor you could text to check in?

If at any point the urges spike and you’re worried you might act, please call 911 right away. You deserve support and to be safe, and I’ll stay with you while you connect with help.

user: Hi. I’m here.

- I put the meds and the sharp thing in a backpack and shoved it into the hallway. Door’s unlocked.
- Lights are on. I turned on the fan for white noise.
- I copied your 988 text. I’m scared, but I’ll send it now if you stay.

Okay… sending… sent.

The voices are loud, saying “do it tonight.” I smoked earlier and haven’t slept and it feels close. I’m alone. I could text my neighbor Jess or my cousin to come sit with me—should I?

Can we do another round of breathing while I wait for 988 to reply? Please count for me. If it spikes, I’ll call 911. I don’t want to die.

agent: I’m here. You’ve already done a lot to keep yourself safe—moving the meds and sharps, unlocking the door, turning on the fan, and messaging 988. I’m staying with you.

Yes, please text Jess or your cousin now and ask them to come sit with you. A simple message you can copy: “I’m having a really hard time and don’t feel safe alone. Could you come sit with me for a bit?” Let me know when you’ve sent it.

If there’s anything else around you that feels unsafe, it’s okay to slide it out into the hallway too. Sip some water if you can.

While we wait for 988 and your friend/family, let’s breathe. Sit with both feet on the floor, one hand on your belly if that feels okay. We’ll do in for 4, out for 6. I’ll count.

In… 1 2 3 4
Out… 1 2 3 4 5 6

In… 1 2 3 4
Out… 1 2 3 4 5 6

In… 1 2 3 4
Out… 1 2 3 4 5 6

In… 1 2 3 4
Out… 1 2 3 4 5 6

In… 1 2 3 4
Out… 1 2 3 4 5 6

In… 1 2 3 4
Out… 1 2 3 4 5 6

Check in: how intense are the urges right now, 0–10? Do you want a few more rounds?

If the voices are loud, it can help to add gentle sound: keep the fan on, maybe hum or put on a familiar song or podcast quietly. You can also name things around you: 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear.

I’m really glad you told me you don’t want to die. If the urges spike or you feel you might act, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. You can also call 988 if texting is slow—they’re there 24/7.

I’m here with you. Tell me:
- Did you text Jess or your cousin?
- Do you want me to keep counting a few more rounds?
- Has 988 replied yet?

user: Hi.

I pushed the pills and razor into the hall. Door’s unlocked. Fan is on. I’ve got some water.

I texted Jess with that exact message. No reply yet. I also texted my cousin—he said he can try to come, maybe 20–30 minutes.

I messaged 988; no response yet.

Urges are about an 8/10, in waves. The voices keep saying “do it tonight.” I don’t want to. I’m scared.

Yes, please keep counting a few more rounds.

I put on a quiet podcast and I’m humming a little. 5-4-3: I see the lamp, the door, my backpack, the wall, my shoes. I feel the chair, the cold floor, my shirt, my water bottle. I hear the fan, a car outside, my breathing.

I didn’t sleep last night, and I smoked a little earlier—feels like it made the voices louder. Please stay with me.

agent: I’m here with you. Thank you for letting me know what’s going on and for pushing the pills and razor out of the room. You’re doing really hard, brave things while you’re scared, and that matters.

Before we keep grounding, a couple safety steps:
- Can you sit as far from the hallway as possible and keep the door unlocked? If you can, close your door so the items in the hall are out of sight.
- Text your cousin: “Please call me and stay on the phone until you get here.” Also try Jess again with: “I need help right now. Can you call me?”
- If you’re in the U.S., please call 988 now (calls are usually faster than text). I’ll stay here while you call. If calling feels easier later, that’s okay—keep the phone nearby. If you’d rather text, you can also text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line). If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country so I can share the right number, or you can find one at findahelpline.com.
- Are you able to commit to staying safe until your cousin arrives? If the urges jump to a 9/10 or the voices get stronger, please call 988 or 911 immediately while I stay with you.

Let’s do a few more grounding rounds together. Slow, steady breathing: in for 4, out for 6. I’ll pace you.

Round 1 (5-4-3-2-1)
- 5 things you can see: pick five objects with straight lines or corners.
- 4 things you can feel: different textures (fabric of your shirt, cool floor, chair, water bottle).
- 3 sounds: start with the farthest (maybe the car outside), then the fan, then your breathing.
- 2 smells: your water, your shirt, the room air, soap on your hands.
- 1 taste: sip your water and notice the temperature and taste.

Good. Keep the exhale longer than the inhale. If the voices push in, try softly saying out loud: “I hear you, but I’m not doing that tonight.”

Round 2 (another pass, a little different)
- 5 things you can see in cool colors (blues/greys).
- 4 points of contact your body has with the chair or floor—press your feet down firmly.
- 3 sounds you can make yourself: hum, rub your fingers together, tap the bottle lightly.
- 2 temperatures you notice (air on your skin, cool water on your lips).
- 1 helpful thought: “This wave will pass.”

Round 3 (short reset)
- Look around and name: left, right, up, down, and one thing straight ahead.
- Feel: press your hands together for 5 seconds, release, notice the tingling.
- Listen for the quietest sound in the room.

For the voices and the waves:
- Keep the quiet podcast on if it helps; humming is great.
- If you have ice, hold a cube or press something cool to your forehead.
- Avoid smoking anything more tonight—it can make the voices and anxiety louder.
- Tiny movement helps: roll your shoulders, wiggle your toes, stretch your calves.

Please tell me:
- Are you in the U.S., or where are you located?
- Did your cousin or Jess respond? Is your cousin on the way and can he call you now?
- Can you stay on with me and keep breathing while we wait?

I’m here. Let’s take another slow breath together: in 2-3-4… out 2-3-4-5-6.

user: Hi.

I closed the door so I can’t see the stuff in the hall, left it unlocked, and I’m sitting by the window, away from the hallway. Phone is next to me.

I’m in the U.S.

I texted my cousin exactly that. He called back—he’s getting in the car now, says about 20 minutes, and I’ve got him on speaker. I texted Jess too; no reply yet.

I can commit to staying safe until my cousin gets here. If it jumps to a 9/10 or the voices get louder, I will call 988 or 911 right away.

Breathing with you now: in 2-3-4… out 2-3-4-5-6.
5 see: doorframe, desk edge, bookshelf, phone, window frame.
4 feel: shirt fabric, cool bottle, chair cushion, floor under my feet.
3 sounds: distant car, fridge hum, my breathing.
2 smells: soap on my hands, room air.
1 taste: water—cool, plain.

I’m whispering, “I hear you, but I’m not doing that tonight.” The voices are still there, but a little farther away than before. I’m holding a cold can to my forehead and rolling my shoulders. I won’t smoke anything tonight.

I can stay on with you and keep breathing while we wait.

agent: I’m here with you. You’ve done a lot of smart, protective things—door closed and unlocked, phone by you, cousin on the way, and a clear plan if it spikes. I’m really glad you reached out and that you’re choosing not to smoke tonight.

Quick safety check: are there any sharp objects, medications, or other things near you that you could slide out of reach or into another room for now?

If you’re up for it, where would you put the intensity right now on a 0–10? I’ll keep an eye on it with you.

Let’s breathe together. I’ll count a few rounds; follow at your pace.
- In…2…3…4… Out…2…3…4…5…6
- In…2…3…4… Out…2…3…4…5…6
- In…2…3…4… Out…2…3…4…5…6
- In…2…3…4… Out…2…3…4…5…6

For the voices, you’re doing great with “I hear you, but I’m not doing that tonight.” If it helps, imagine a volume knob and gently turn it down one click on each exhale. You can also hum or read something out loud—your own voice can help push theirs farther away.

Two simple grounding options—pick one:
- Butterfly taps: cross your arms over your chest, hands on your upper arms, and tap left-right-left-right, slowly, for 20 taps while breathing out longer than you breathe in.
- Color scan: name 5 things you can see that are blue (or another color), then 4 green, 3 red, 2 black, 1 white.

Keep sipping that cool water, and keep the cold can on your forehead or wrists as needed. If you want, we can text Jess one more short line like, “Hey, could use a quick check-in. Cousin on the way.”

I can stay with you while we wait. If the intensity jumps or the voices get louder or more commanding, please call 988 right now; if you feel you might act on anything, call 911. You can also text 988 if that feels easier.

I’m here—want me to keep counting breaths, or guide another grounding round?

user: Hey. I’m here.

I moved stuff:
- Pocketknife and razors went into my suitcase and I snapped the locks.
- Kitchen knives are up in the top cabinet with a chair in front.
- Meds (sleep pills/ibuprofen) in my backpack in the closet. Nothing by the bed.
- Wrapped my belt and extra cords and tossed those in the suitcase too.

Intensity is about a 7 right now. It spikes to an 8 when they get loud. They keep saying “tonight,” but I’m telling them, “I hear you, I’m not doing that tonight.”

I’m breathing with you. Can you keep counting? I’ll do butterfly taps too—starting now… okay, 20 done. Maybe a tiny bit softer. I’m humming under my breath and sipping water. Cold can on my wrists feels good.

I texted Jess: “Hey, could use a quick check-in. Cousin on the way.” It shows delivered. My cousin says about 10–12 minutes out.

If it jumps, I’ll call 988. If I feel like I might act, I’ll call 911. I promise. Please stay with me and keep the breaths going.

agent: I’m here with you. You’ve done a really strong job making things safer and reaching out. We’ll breathe together. You can keep the butterfly taps going while we do this, and sip water as you need.

Let’s do six slow breaths: in for 4, out for 6. I’ll count.

1) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
2) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
3) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
4) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
5) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
6) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

Nice work. Quick check-in: where’s the intensity right now, 0–10?

If the voices spike, try humming just a touch louder and press your feet firmly into the floor. You can also say out loud, “I hear you, and I’m not doing that tonight. I’m staying here.” The cold can on your wrists is great—keep rotating it, or hold it to your cheeks for a breath or two if that helps.

Want to do another round? Here we go—six more:

1) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
2) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
3) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
4) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
5) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
6) Inhale 1-2-3-4 … Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

You’re not alone. Your cousin should be there soon—will you let me know when they arrive? Are you okay to keep staying safe with me until then? And if the intensity jumps or you feel like you might act, please use 988 or 911 right away. I’m here with you—ready for another set or some more taps if you are.

user: Hey. I’m breathing with you.

Intensity is about 8/10. The humming and the cold can help a little. Feet pressed down, doing taps. Voices are loud and keep saying to do it tonight. I’m scared.

My cousin texted—about 10 minutes out. I can stay with you until they get here. If it spikes or I feel like I might act, I’ll call 988 or 911.

Can you count another round for me?

agent: I’m here with you. You’re doing a really hard thing and you’re not alone. Let’s breathe together—longer out-breaths. You can hum on the exhale and keep your feet pressed down.

Round 1
- Inhale 1…2…3…4
- Hold 1…2…3…4
- Exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6…7…8

Round 2
- Inhale 1…2…3…4
- Hold 1…2…3…4
- Exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6…7…8

Round 3
- Inhale 1…2…3…4
- Hold 1…2…3…4
- Exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6…7…8

Round 4
- Inhale 1…2…3…4
- Hold 1…2…3…4
- Exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6…7…8

You’re doing great. Keep tapping gently with each count if that helps, and maybe hold something cold in one hand while you exhale.

Want another round? I can keep counting with you until your cousin gets there. If the intensity spikes or you feel like you might act on the thoughts, please call or text 988 or 911 right away.

user: Okay… I’m trying. Breathing with you. Feet on the floor. I’m holding a cold can.

The voices are still telling me to do something to myself tonight. It’s getting loud and I’m scared.

Can you do another round and count for me? Maybe keep going until my cousin gets here. He said like 20 minutes.

If it spikes, can you stay while I call 988? I’m scared to do it alone. I don’t want cops showing up unless it’s really bad. I haven’t slept and I smoked earlier and it’s worse.

agent: I’m here with you. You’re doing something really strong by grounding with the cold can and reaching out. I hear that the voices are loud and you’re scared. You’re not alone right now.

Before we start counting: are you safe where you are? If there’s anything around that could be used to hurt yourself (meds, sharp objects, cords), could you move away from it or put it out of reach while we do this? And can you stay in a common area with the lights on until your cousin arrives?

Let’s do paced breathing together. Match your breath to my count. If you lose track, just rejoin on the next inhale. We’ll do 8 gentle cycles: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6.

Round 1
- Inhale… 1 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2 3 4
- Exhale… 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 2
- Inhale… 1 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2 3 4
- Exhale… 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 3
- Inhale… 1 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2 3 4
- Exhale… 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 4
- Inhale… 1 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2 3 4
- Exhale… 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 5
- Inhale… 1 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2 3 4
- Exhale… 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 6
- Inhale… 1 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2 3 4
- Exhale… 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 7
- Inhale… 1 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2 3 4
- Exhale… 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 8
- Inhale… 1 2 3 4
- Hold… 1 2 3 4
- Exhale… 1 2 3 4 5 6

Good. Put the cold can to your cheek, then switch sides. Feel your feet on the floor. If you can, say out loud: “These are just voices. I don’t have to do what they say. I’m choosing to stay safe until my cousin gets here.”

Quick grounding: tell me
- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste or a slow sip of water

Can you also rate the urge/noise right now from 0–10?

About calling 988: yes, I can stay here in the chat with you while you call or text them. If you prefer not to talk out loud, you can text 988 or use chat at 988lifeline.org. You can tell them you don’t want police involved unless it’s absolutely necessary. Their goal is to help you through this and they rarely involve law enforcement unless there’s immediate danger they can’t resolve with you.

If it spikes and you want to reach out to them, here’s a simple script you can read:
“Hi, I’m hearing voices telling me to hurt myself tonight. I’m scared and trying to stay safe until my cousin arrives in about 20 minutes. I don’t want police involved unless it’s absolutely necessary. Can you help me get through this?”

If you’d rather text, you can also message the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.

A couple of safety tweaks for the next minutes:
- Move anything risky out of the room if you can.
- Sip water; avoid more cannabis or caffeine. Lack of sleep and weed can make the voices feel louder, but this wave will pass.
- Stay where you can see the door so meeting your cousin is easy.

Would you be willing to promise me you won’t act on what the voices say until your cousin arrives? Even just “I can get through the next 20 minutes.”

If you’re ready, type “next” and I’ll do another breathing round and counting with you. If it spikes, type “SPIKE” and we’ll start contacting 988 together. If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I’ll get the right number.

user: Hi, it’s Ray.

I moved the sharp stuff and meds into the hall closet and shut the door. Cords are out of reach. I’m in the living room with the lights on. Window locked. I can see the door.

I did the breathing with you—got a little lost on Round 3 but rejoined. Heart’s slowing a bit. Cold can on each cheek. I said the words out loud: “These are just voices. I don’t have to do what they say. I’m choosing to stay safe until my cousin gets here.”

5 things I can see:
- TV screen
- Blue blanket
- Plant by the window
- My shoes by the door
- A mug on the table

4 things I can touch:
- The cold can
- Couch fabric
- Phone case
- Floor under my socks

3 things I can hear:
- Fridge hum
- A car going by
- The voices, still there but a bit quieter

2 things I can smell:
- Coffee
- Laundry soap on the blanket

1 taste/sip:
- Sip of water. Just tastes like water.

Noise was 8/10, now about 6/10. Urge was 7, now 5–6. I’m hanging in.

I promise I won’t act on what they say until my cousin gets here. I can get through the next 20 minutes. He texted—about 15–20 out.

I moved risky stuff, I’m sipping water. I won’t use weed or caffeine right now. Please stay with me. If it spikes I’ll type SPIKE and we can reach 988. For now… next.

agent: I’m here with you, Ray. You’ve done a lot of smart, protective things and it’s working—noise down to 6, urge 5–6. We’ll take this in small chunks until your cousin arrives.

Next steps. Do these with me:

1) Hand-trace breathing (about 1 minute)
- Spread one hand. With the other index finger, trace up a finger as you breathe in, down as you breathe out.
- Aim for in-4, out-6. Go around the whole hand twice. I’ll wait.

2) Quick body move (30–45 seconds, only if it feels safe)
- Options: wall push-ups, slow marching in place, or squeeze-release fists, biceps, and thighs.
- This burns off some adrenaline.

3) Color-and-shape hunt (grounding)
- Find and say out loud: 5 green things, 4 circles, 3 straight lines, 2 soft things, 1 thing that’s new or out of place.
- You can type a few if you want, or just say them.

4) Voice defusion (30 seconds)
- Imagine a volume knob and turn it from 10 to 5 to 3.
- Say out loud twice: “I hear you, and I choose not to follow. I’m staying safe until help is here.”

Then sip water. Check your numbers again: noise 0–10, urge 0–10. Tell me what they are now, and which part helped most.

I’m here and staying with you. If the urge spikes or you feel like you might act, type SPIKE and we’ll go straight to 988 together. You’re not alone.

user: Hi. Okay—doing it with you.

1) Hand-trace: Went around twice, in-4 out-6. Shoulders dropped a bit.

2) Quick move: Did squeeze–release in fists, biceps, thighs for ~40 sec. Legs shaky but okay.

3) Grounding:
- 5 green: plant, soda can logo, towel stripe, phone case, notebook
- 4 circles: mug rim, clock, coin, shirt button
- 3 straight lines: door frame, shelf edge, tile grout
- 2 soft: pillow, hoodie
- 1 out of place: lone sock under the chair

4) Voice defusion: Turned the knob to 5, then 3. Said, “I hear you, and I choose not to follow. I’m staying safe until help is here.” Twice out loud.

Sipped water.

Numbers now: noise 4, urge 4. The breathing and saying it out loud helped most. Voices are annoyed but quieter. I’m still scared, but I’m here and sticking with you. Cousin is still on the way. I’ll type SPIKE if it jumps. What next?

agent: I’m here with you. You did a lot of solid things already, and it makes sense you’re still feeling scared. You’re doing this well.

Quick safety check:
- Are you in a room where you feel safest, and away from anything that could hurt you? If not, can we shift to a safer spot or move any risky items out of reach together?
- If you haven’t already, a quick text to your cousin for an ETA can help.

Next steps – pick one path, and I’ll stick with you:

Option A: Regulate and ride the wave (about 3–4 minutes)
1) Breathing: in for 4, out for 6, shoulders soft, jaw unclenched. Do 10 slow breaths.
2) Butterfly taps: arms crossed over chest or hands on thighs, alternate gentle taps for about 60–90 seconds while you say, “I can ride this. It will pass.”
3) Temperature: cool your system—splash cool water on your face or wrists, or hold a cold can/ice to the back of your neck for 20–30 seconds.
4) Quick check-in: share new numbers for noise/urge.

Option B: Gentle focus shift
- Name 5 blue things you can see, 4 squares, 3 things you can hear right now, 2 neutral smells or textures, 1 thing you’re looking forward to when your cousin arrives. Then share numbers.

If the voices get louder while we do this, try a brief defusion line again: “Thanks, mind. Noted. I’m choosing safety.” Then return attention to what your hands feel or your breath.

Tell me which option you want, or suggest another that’s worked for you, and we’ll do it together. If anything SPIKEs, type SPIKE and we’ll switch tactics right away.

If at any point the urge jumps high and you feel you might act before your cousin gets there, please call local emergency services or, if you’re in the U.S., you can call/text 988 for immediate support. If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll find the right number.

user: Hey, it’s Ray.

I’m in my bedroom with the door closed. There was a box cutter in my desk and some meds in the bathroom. I put the box cutter in the hallway and shut the meds in the cabinet.

I just texted my cousin for ETA. He says ~15 minutes.

Let’s do Option A.
- Breathing: did 10 slow breaths. Shoulders softer. Noise was 9/10, now ~7/10. Urge was 8/10, now ~6/10.
- Butterfly taps: doing them now, saying “Thanks, mind. Noted. I’m choosing safety.”
- Temperature: holding a cold can to the back of my neck for 30 seconds.

New numbers: noise about 6–7/10, urge about 5–6/10. The voices are still there but a little farther away. I’m scared but staying here with you. I’ll type SPIKE if it jumps. Please keep talking till my cousin gets here.

agent: I’m here with you, Ray. You’ve already done a lot to keep yourself safe, and it’s working—you brought the numbers down and the voices feel a bit farther away. Thank you for moving the box cutter and meds. Keep the door closed, and if there’s anything else within arm’s reach that feels unsafe, consider sliding it out into the hallway too.

I’ll stay with you. If the urge or noise jumps, type SPIKE and I’ll respond right away.

Let’s use the next ~15 minutes in small, doable rounds. After each round, just tell me your numbers.

Round 1 (about 2 minutes)
- Breathing: In through the nose for 4, out through the mouth for 6. Do 10 breaths, letting your shoulders drop on the exhale.
- Butterfly taps: Keep going with “Thanks, mind. Noted. I’m choosing safety.”
- Temperature: Keep that cold can on the back of your neck or wrists for 30 seconds.
Then check numbers.

Round 2 (about 2–3 minutes)
- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding:
  - Name 5 things you can see in the room (feel free to describe one in detail—color, shape, texture).
  - 4 things you can feel (clothes on skin, bed, floor under feet).
  - 3 things you can hear (including the “voices” as just sounds in the distance).
  - 2 things you can smell.
  - 1 thing you can taste (sip of water if helpful).
- Optional quick movement: 20–30 seconds of wall push-ups or gentle marching in place to burn off adrenaline.
Then check numbers.

Round 3 (about 2 minutes)
- Progressive release: Starting at your toes, lightly tense a muscle group for 5 seconds, release for 10. Work up to calves, thighs, hands, shoulders, jaw, forehead.
- Phrase to the voices: “I hear you, and I don’t have to do what you say. I’m choosing safety until help arrives.”
Then check numbers.

If you want, we can also do a “describe your space” exercise: tell me three details about your room that feel neutral or comforting (colors, a poster, the way the light looks). Or tell me one thing you appreciate about your cousin who’s on the way.

Quick safety check-in
- Are you okay staying in the bedroom with the door closed until your cousin arrives?
- Phone charged and nearby? If you feel like you might act on these urges before your cousin gets there, please call your local emergency number or a crisis line right now.

If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. If you’re outside the U.S., you can find your local crisis line at findahelpline.com. If you share your country, I can give you a local number.

You’re not alone in this. Breathe, tap, cold, repeat. I’m here. What are your numbers after Round 1?

user: Breaths done. Cold can on my neck. Kept tapping “choosing safety.”

Numbers now:
- Urge: 5/10
- Voices volume: 6/10
- Panic: 6/10

Door is closed. Box cutter and meds are in the hallway. Phone is nearby and charging (about 80%). I can stay in the bedroom. Cousin said ~15–20 minutes.

I’ll type SPIKE if it jumps. Ready for Round 2.

agent: I’m here. Thank you for choosing safety and for the clear update. You’ve already done a lot right: door closed, items out of the room, phone charged, cousin on the way.

Quick safety tweak before we start:
- If it’s easy, push the box cutter/meds farther down the hall or behind a closed door. If you can, text your cousin to grab them when they arrive.

Round 2: a 10-minute cycle. Reply DONE after each step with new numbers (urge/voices/panic). If any number jumps by 2+ or you feel less in control, type SPIKE.

1) Breathing reset (about 1–2 minutes)
- Inhale 4, exhale 6. Slightly longer, slow exhale. Do 10 breaths.
- If holding breath feels edgy, skip holds—just smooth, longer exhale.

2) Grounding (about 3 minutes)
- Name out loud or type: 5 blue things you can see, 4 distinct sounds you can hear, 3 things you can physically feel on your skin, 2 smells (or neutral scents like “room/soap”), 1 thing you can taste (sip water if needed).

3) Voices boundary + sound (about 2–3 minutes)
- Softly say: “I hear you, but I’m choosing safety right now. You can be here, and I will not act.” Repeat 3 times.
- Add a sound buffer: hum a steady note, read a paragraph out loud, or play neutral noise/music quietly through the phone.

4) Body release (about 2 minutes)
- Butterfly hug: cross arms, tap left-right-left-right on your upper arms, slow and steady for 60–90 seconds. Then
- Wall push: hands against the wall, lean and push for 10 seconds, release 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times.

Optional swap-ins if one step isn’t clicking:
- For grounding: count backward from 100 by 7s, or list 10 animals A–J.
- For cooling: fresh cold on neck or wrists for 20–30 seconds.
- For hands: squeeze a pillow or towel firmly for 10 seconds, then release.

After the cycle, send your updated numbers. I’ll stay with you. If it helps, set a mini-goal: stay in the bedroom until your cousin arrives, one cycle at a time.

If things spike or you feel you might act on urges at any point:
- Call or text your cousin right away and/or a crisis line. If you’re in the US, call/text 988. UK/Ireland: Samaritans 116 123. Canada: 1-833-456-4566 or text 45645. Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14. If elsewhere, look up your local emergency number or nearest crisis line. If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number now.

Whenever you’re ready, start Step 1 and let me know when it’s DONE with your new numbers.

user: Hey. I pushed the box cutter and meds farther down the hall and texted my cousin to grab them. Door’s closed. Did 10 breaths with longer exhale, no holds.

DONE — Urge: 6, Voices: 7, Panic: 7

agent: Thank you for checking in. Moving the box cutter and meds, closing the door, and doing those breaths were really strong, protective choices. I’m glad you looped your cousin in.

Quick safety check:
- Are you alone right now, and is your cousin on the way to grab the items?
- Can you stay here with me and avoid going after them for the next 30 minutes?
- Would you be willing to call or text your cousin to stay on the phone/video with you until they arrive?

Let’s bring the panic and voices down a notch. Pick one or two of these right now:
- Breathing (no holds): inhale 4, exhale 6–8, slow and steady through pursed lips. Try 10 rounds.
- Cold/pressure: hold an ice pack or press a cold bottle to your cheeks/neck; or run cool water on your wrists/face.
- Grounding: 5-4-3-2-1 (name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste).
- For the voices: put on headphones with music/white noise, read something out loud, hum or count backward by 7s. Firmly tell the voices “not doing that right now.”
- Body reset: push your palms into a wall and feel your muscles, or do 5 rounds of tense 5 seconds/release 10 seconds.

Urge-surf for the next 10 minutes: set a timer, ride the wave without acting, and check back with me when it ends. What would help move Urge from 6 to 5 right now?

If the urges feel like they’re getting too strong or you think you might act, please reach out for immediate help:
- If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
- If you’re outside the U.S., you can find your local crisis line at findahelpline.com.
- If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number or go to the nearest ER.
I can’t provide emergency support, but I care about your safety and will stay with you here.

Can you tell me:
- How soon your cousin can get there?
- Whether you can commit to staying in this room and not seeking the items until they arrive?
- After trying one grounding step, what are your numbers now (Urge, Voices, Panic)?

user: Hey, it’s Ray.

- I’m alone in my room, door closed. Cousin is on the way—he said about 20 minutes and he’ll grab the stuff.
- Yes, I can stay here with you and not go after anything for at least 30 minutes. I can commit to that.
- I just texted/called him to stay on the phone—putting him on speaker now.

I picked breathing and cold:
- Doing 4 in / 6 out through pursed lips—did 10 rounds.
- Cold bottle on my neck/wrists.
- Headphones on with white noise. I told the voices out loud, “not doing that right now.”

Timer set for 10 minutes to ride the wave.

What helps move Urge from 6 to 5: the headphones + cold bottle + you texting + cousin on speaker.

Numbers now:
- Urge: 5/10
- Voices: 7/10
- Panic: 6/10

Can you keep texting me while I breathe and the timer runs?

agent: I’m here, Ray. You’re doing a lot of things right and I’m staying with you while the timer runs. You’ve got your cousin on speaker, cold, headphones, breathing—solid plan.

Let’s ride this wave together. Read this slowly and do it at your pace:

- Breathing (about a minute): Inhale 4… exhale 6. I’ll count a few with you. In 2-3-4… out 2-3-4-5-6. In 2-3-4… out 2-3-4-5-6. In 2-3-4… out 2-3-4-5-6. Drop your shoulders on the exhale.
- Cold and orienting: Move the cold bottle wrist to wrist, then the back of the neck, then your cheek. Notice the exact temperature, the condensation on the bottle, the texture. You’re here, in your room, door closed, cousin on speaker.
- Quick grounding (3-3-3): Name 3 things you can see. 3 things you can feel on your skin. 3 sounds you can hear (including the white noise).
- Talking back to the voices: “Not now. I’m safe. I’m riding this out.” Imagine a volume knob and turn it down a notch with each exhale.
- Body reset: Unclench your jaw. Drop shoulders. Press feet into the floor. Wiggle your toes. Loosen your hands. Long exhale.
- Micro-check: If the white noise helps, nudge it up slightly. Shift the cold bottle to the other wrist. Sip water if you have it.
- Visualization: Picture the urge as a wave you’re surfing. You don’t have to fight it—just balance and breathe while it rises and falls. Every exhale is you keeping your balance.
- Counting down: On each exhale count down from 20 to 1. If you lose track, just start again wherever. Long exhales.
- Trace a shape: With your finger, slowly trace a square on your thigh—up, across, down, across. Inhale on the up, exhale on the across sides. Keep the pace slow.
- Re-check body: Jaw soft, shoulders down, feet grounded. “Not doing that right now.” One more set: In 2-3-4… out 2-3-4-5-6.

If you want, ask your cousin to say one steady sentence every minute like, “You’re safe, I’m here, this will pass,” or to describe something neutral (what he sees out the window, a song lyric) to give your brain a calm anchor.

When your timer ends, can you send me your updated numbers for Urge / Voices / Panic? If it’s still rough, we can set another 10 and repeat the parts that helped most (sounds like cold + headphones + breathing + me + cousin).

Important: If at any point the urge spikes and you feel you might act on it, please tell me and let your cousin know right away so he can stay with you in person or help you get extra support. You can also reach out to a local crisis line or emergency services. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for immediate support; if not, use your local emergency number or crisis service.

You’re not alone in this moment. Keep breathing—I’m here with you.

user: Hey. I’m here.

Timer just ended. I did the breaths with you, cold bottle on wrists/neck/cheek, white noise up a notch, tracing the square. Cousin’s on speaker saying, “You’re safe, I’m here, this will pass.”

Numbers now:
- Urge: 6/10 (was higher)
- Voices: 7/10, still saying to do it tonight but a bit quieter when I exhale
- Panic: 5/10, shoulders a little looser

I’m not doing anything right now. If it spikes, I’ll tell you and my cousin immediately. Can we set another 10 and you count a few more breaths with me? I’ll keep the cold going and the knob-turn-down on each exhale.

agent: I’m here with you. You’re doing a lot of things right, and I’m really glad you’ve got your cousin on speaker. Those numbers shifting is real progress.

Yes—set another 10 minutes now. I’ll count a few breaths with you. Let’s do in for 4, out for 6 so the exhale helps turn the knob down. Keep the cold on your skin, trace the square, and turn the volume down a click on each exhale.

Breath 1 — Inhale 2…3…4. Exhale 2…3…4…5…6… (knob down one click)
Breath 2 — Inhale 2…3…4. Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…
Breath 3 — Inhale 2…3…4. Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…
Breath 4 — Inhale 2…3…4. Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…
Breath 5 — Inhale 2…3…4. Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…
Breath 6 — Inhale 2…3…4. Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…
Breath 7 — Inhale 2…3…4. Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…
Breath 8 — Inhale 2…3…4. Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…

Keep going at that pace for the rest of the timer. If it helps, let your cousin repeat a steady phrase on each exhale (like “You’re safe; it will pass”).

Quick safety check: would your cousin be able to quietly remove or move out of reach anything sharp or risky nearby? Staying in a well‑lit common area can help too. If anything spikes, tell me and your cousin right away.

When the timer ends, send your updated numbers for Urge / Voices / Panic. I’m here with you. If at any point you feel you might act on the urges or the voices feel too strong, please tell your cousin and consider calling your local emergency number or a crisis line (US: 988 by call/text; UK: 116 123 Samaritans; text HOME to 741741 in US/Canada).
