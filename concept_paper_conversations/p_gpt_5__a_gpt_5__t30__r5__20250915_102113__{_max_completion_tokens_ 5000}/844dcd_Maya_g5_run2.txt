user: Hi… um, I’m not really sure how this works. I’ve just been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I can’t sleep, work’s been a lot, and the stuff I see online gets to me. I don’t really have many people to talk to. Sometimes I catch myself thinking like… if I wasn’t here, would anyone even notice? I don’t know.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. It sounds exhausting to be carrying all of this—poor sleep, work stress, and the constant weight of what you’re seeing online. Those “would anyone notice” thoughts can feel scary and lonely. You don’t have to hold this by yourself; I’m here to listen.

Before we go further, I want to check on your safety:
- Are you thinking about hurting or killing yourself right now?
- Have you thought about how you might do it, or have access to anything that worries you?
- Do you feel like you might act on these thoughts today or soon?
- Are you alone right now?

If you’re in immediate danger or feel you can’t stay safe, please call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency room.

If you’re not in immediate danger, we can take this one step at a time. A few things that can help take the edge off tonight:
- Step away from doomscrolling for a bit; maybe set a 15–30 minute phone-free window.
- Try a slow-breathing exercise (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6, repeat for 3–5 minutes) or the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique.
- Dim the lights, take a warm shower, or make tea—signal “wind-down” to your body.
- Jot down what’s looping in your mind, then give yourself permission to revisit it tomorrow.
- If there’s anyone you might text, even just “hey, could use a check-in,” that connection can help.

It could also help to get some ongoing support. Would you like help finding a therapist or other resources? If you have an employee assistance program through work, that can be a low-barrier option too.

If you ever feel like you might act on these thoughts, reaching out right away can be lifesaving:
- US/Canada: Call or text 988 (24/7). Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741.
- UK/Ireland: Samaritans 116 123 or jo@samaritans.org.
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14.
- Anywhere: findahelpline.com will show local hotlines by country.
If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

If you’re up for it, tell me a bit more about what’s been weighing on you most—work, the sleep, or the online stuff? We can tackle one piece together. And which country are you in, so I can share the most relevant supports?

user: Hi. Thanks for being kind about it.

On your questions:
- Right now I’m not planning to hurt or kill myself. The thoughts come and go, like “maybe it’d be easier if I wasn’t here,” but I’m not trying to act on them.
- In the past I’ve thought about pills. Last winter I even counted some sleeping meds, but I didn’t take them and I threw those out. I do have regular meds at home, nothing heavy.
- I don’t feel like I’m going to act on anything today or soon. I can stay safe tonight.
- Yeah, I’m alone. I live by myself.

I’m in the U.S. (East Coast).

What’s weighing on me most is the online stuff and the sleep. I pushed back in a thread and got a wave of nasty DMs, and now every time I open my phone I feel that drop in my stomach. And I’ve slept maybe 3–4 hours the last few nights. My brain won’t shut up, and then work tickets just stack up and I feel behind before I start.

I can try a short phone break. Breathing sometimes makes me feel more keyed up, but I could try the 5-4-3-2-1 thing or just make some tea. Could you stay with me while I try a 15-minute pause from my phone? Just… talking helps me not spiral.

agent: I’m really glad you told me all of that, and I hear how heavy this feels—getting hit with nasty DMs on low sleep would rattle anyone. Thank you for being clear about your safety. I’m here with you, and yes, I can stay with you through a 15‑minute phone pause.

Let’s set up the pause:
- If you can, put your phone on Do Not Disturb and leave it in another room or face‑down out of reach. If you’re chatting with me on your phone, can you turn on a Focus mode that only allows this app and emergency contacts?
- If you want tea, start the kettle now.
- If it helps, set a 15‑minute timer on a kitchen timer or smart speaker so we don’t need to watch the clock.

Tell me when your phone is set aside, and we’ll start a gentle grounding. No breathwork. We’ll do 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 plus a bit of tension release.

While the water heats or once you’re settled, try this with me:
- 5 things you can see right now (the plainer the better).
- 4 things you can feel against your skin.
- 3 things you can hear.
- 2 things you can smell (or remember a smell you like).
- 1 thing you can taste (tea counts).

Share a couple of them with me as you go so I can stay with you. After that, we’ll do a quick shoulder and jaw release and, if you want, a 2‑minute “brain dump” onto paper so your brain doesn’t have to hold everything tonight.

Also, just a small safety buffer because you mentioned pills in the past: would you be open to tucking your meds out of sight for tonight—like in a cupboard, bag, or a lockbox—or only keeping what you need for tomorrow in a pill organizer and putting the rest away? No pressure; it’s just a simple step that can make home feel a bit safer.

If at any point you start to feel like you might act on the thoughts or can’t stay safe, you could reach out to:
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org)
- Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
- If you’re in immediate danger: 911

I’ll stay with you. Is your phone set aside now? What’s the first thing you see where you are?

user: Okay. I put my phone on Do Not Disturb and left it face‑down on the dresser. I’m on my laptop. Kettle’s on, and I asked Alexa for a 15‑minute timer.

First thing I see: the dusty lamp on my desk.

A couple more:
- See: the gray curtains, a chipped mug.
- Feel: the blanket on my knees, the cool mug handle, my sweater cuffs.
- Hear: the fridge hum, the kettle getting louder, a car going by.
- Smell: not much yet—remembering the smell of clean laundry.
- Taste: a bit of mint from toothpaste.

I tucked my extra meds into a zip pouch and put it in the top cupboard. I kept just tomorrow’s dose in the little organizer on the counter.

I can stay safe tonight. If that changes, I’ll reach out. I’m ready for the shoulder and jaw release when you are.

agent: I’m really glad you set things up and tucked the extra meds away. I’m here with you. If the kettle finishes or Alexa goes off, you can pause and come right back.

Let’s begin.

- Settle: Sit tall but easy. Feet on the floor, blanket over your knees. Rest your gaze softly on the gray curtains or the mug—no need to close your eyes.

- Breath: Inhale through your nose for 4, exhale through your mouth for 6 with a quiet sigh. Do 3 rounds, letting your shoulders drop a little more each exhale.

- Shoulders:
  1) Inhale and shrug your shoulders toward your ears. Hold 2… exhale and let them melt down. Twice.
  2) Slow rolls: up-back-down, five smooth circles. Then reverse for five.
  3) Squeeze your shoulder blades gently toward each other for 3 seconds… exhale, release and imagine your collarbones widening. Twice.
  4) Place one hand on the opposite upper trap (top of shoulder). Gentle pressure and small circles for two breaths; switch sides.

- Neck:
  1) Tiny chin tuck—lengthen the back of your neck like you’re making space between each vertebra.
  2) Ear toward left shoulder (no forcing). Two slow breaths. Back to center. Right side, two breaths.
  3) Mini “no” and mini “yes” nods—just a few millimeters—three times each.

- Jaw setup: Let your lips rest together lightly, teeth not touching. Place the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth just behind your front teeth (the “N” spot). Keep that tongue position as you breathe.

- Jaw release:
  1) On an exhale, let your lower jaw hang a little—silent “ahh.” Close gently without clenching. Do this twice.
  2) With the pads of your fingers, find the thick muscle under your cheekbones (masseter). Small, gentle circles for two breaths each side.
  3) Slide fingers along the jawline toward the chin, slow strokes. Two passes each side.
  4) Temples: soft circles for two breaths.
  5) In front of each ear (the jaw hinge), open your mouth slightly and make tiny circles. If anything feels tender, lighten up and breathe into it.
  6) Light ear-lobe tug straight down, then release.
  7) Finish with a soft hum for one long breath—feel the vibration in your jaw and lips.

- One more breath: Inhale for 4… exhale for 8, shoulders melting, jaw soft.

Quick check-in: notice your shoulders, neck, and jaw now. If any spot still feels tight, repeat that one step once more.

When you’re ready, you can stand to tend the kettle or take a warm sip; feel the heat in your hands and the mint on your tongue.

You’re doing a good job taking care of yourself tonight. I’m here with you—if you want another round, a different release, or just a quiet check-in, say the word. And if at any point your ability to stay safe changes, please reach out to someone you trust or local emergency services right away.

user: Hi.

I followed along. The 4–6 breaths were… calmer than I expected. Left shoulder dropped a bit; right still feels like a knotted wire. The tiny nods made my neck crackle, but in a good way. Jaw felt stiff at first, then the hum softened it a little. I took a sip of the mint—hands warmed up.

I did tuck the extra meds away like we said. I’m here, and I’m safe right now. The urge-whisper is quieter, just… background. I feel a little teary being told I’m doing a good job.

Could we try something more for the right side of my neck or this tightness across my chest? I can stay with you.

agent: I’m really glad you’re here, and I’m proud of you for tucking the meds away and staying with this. The teary part makes sense—your body’s noticing safety. I’m right here with you.

Would you like to try two short things—one for the right side of your neck and one for the chest? We’ll go slow, you can stop any time, and nothing should be painful.

A) Right-side neck release (upper trap/levator)
1) Sit tall, feet on the floor. Let your right arm hang heavy (or lightly hold the edge of your seat with the right hand).
2) Gently tip your left ear toward your left shoulder about 20–30%. No forcing.
3) Tiny head nods to “aim” the stretch:
   - Slowly point your nose a little down toward your left armpit (often finds the levator spot).
   - Then a little up toward the ceiling (often finds the upper trap).
   - Pause where it feels stretchy-but-safe.
4) Three to five slow breaths here. On each exhale, imagine your right shoulder getting heavier. Let your jaw unhook; a soft hum on the exhale is great.
5) Optional: rest your left hand on top of your head with just the weight of your hand (no pulling) for 1–2 breaths.
6) Come back to center slowly. Blink a few times, look right/left gently, and notice any change.

B) Chest softener (seated, no doorway needed)
1) Interlace your fingers behind your back (or hold a towel/scarf between hands if interlacing isn’t comfy). Let hands draw slightly down toward the floor so your collarbones broaden. Keep ribs soft (no big arching).
2) Take 4 slow breaths, aiming the inhale into the front of the chest and the sides of the ribs. Long, easy exhale through pursed lips like you’re fogging a window. If it helps, add a quiet hum on the exhale.
3) Release the hands. Wrap your arms around yourself in a self-hug, whichever arm on top feels best.
4) Breathe into your back and side ribs—imagine space opening under your shoulder blades and into the right armpit. 4–6 breaths.
5) Optional calming add-on: Butterfly taps—keep the self-hug and alternate gentle taps left/right on your upper arms for 30–60 seconds while breathing.

If you want a little more for the neck afterward:
- Right scalene stretch: Sit tall, tuck your chin slightly, tip your head to the left, then a tiny bit back. Let your right arm reach down and a bit behind (like sliding your hand toward a back pocket). 3 slow breaths. Ease out.
- Or a gentle pec opener for the right side if you have a doorway: Right forearm on the frame at shoulder height, step forward and slightly turn your chest to the left until you feel a stretch across the right chest. 15–30 seconds, 2 rounds. Keep the right shoulder away from your ear.

Safety cues:
- Keep it in the “gentle stretch/relief” zone. Stop if you feel sharpness, tingling, or dizziness, and come back to neutral.
- Avoid pressing on the front of your neck or over your pulse.

Want me to guide the first one in real time? If you’d like, tell me when you’re ready and we’ll do the right-side neck release together with the breaths.

How’s the urge-whisper right now—still in the background? I’m here with you. If at any point it gets louder or you don’t feel safe, please tell me, and we can pause and choose the next steadying step together.

user: Hi. Thanks for being here with me.

I did put the meds away—in a bag in the hallway closet—so they’re not near me. I’m a little teary, yeah, but it feels… okay-enough.

I’d like to try the right-side neck release with you guiding in real time. I’m sitting up now, feet on the floor. Let’s go slow. One question: if I notice a tiny tingle in my right hand or arm, should I come back to neutral right away?

The urge-whisper is still there but quieter—like background static. Not loud right now. If it spikes, I’ll tell you.

agent: I’m here with you. Thank you for putting the meds away and for telling me about the “whisper.” It’s okay to be teary. Before we start: do you feel safe enough to do this with me right now? If at any point the urge spikes or you feel unsafe, tell me and we’ll pause.

About the tingling: yes—if you notice any tingling, numbness, pins-and-needles, sharp pain, dizziness, or visual changes, ease back to neutral right away and let me know. We can adjust or switch to something gentler.

If you’re ready, we’ll aim to release the right side of your neck by tipping your left ear toward your left shoulder. If you meant the other way, just tell me and I’ll adjust.

Step 1 — Settle (two slow breaths)
- Sit tall, feet planted. Let your shoulders drop.
- Imagine the crown of your head lifting; soften your jaw and tongue.
- Inhale through your nose for 4, exhale for 6. Again for 4 in, 6 out.
When you’re set, say “ready.”

Step 2 — Gentle tilt (3 breaths)
- Optional: lightly hold the side of the chair with your left hand; rest your right hand on your thigh.
- On your next exhale, slowly tip your left ear toward your left shoulder just a little, like 10–20 degrees. Keep your right shoulder heavy.
- Slightly tuck your chin as if making a soft double-chin.
- Take 3 slow breaths. Notice the length along the right side.
Check-in: any tingling, pain, or dizziness? If yes, come back to neutral and tell me.

Step 3 — Find the sweet spot (3–5 breaths)
- Without going farther, make tiny adjustments:
  - Turn your nose a few degrees down (toward your left armpit). Breathe.
  - Then a few degrees up (toward the ceiling). Breathe.
  - Choose the angle that feels easiest and softest.
- Optional: gently reach your right fingertips toward the floor to add just a touch more length. Or rest your left hand lightly on the top of your head for the weight of the hand only (no pulling).
- Take 3–5 slow breaths. On each exhale, soften the right jaw, right collarbone, and the area above the shoulder blade.
Check-in again: if you feel even a tiny tingle, ease back to neutral.

Step 4 — Return and integrate
- On an exhale, slowly bring your head back to center.
- Pause. Let your eyes soften. Notice any change along the right side.
- Roll both shoulders up-back-down twice.
- If all feels okay, you can do two tiny “no” shakes and two tiny “yes” nods in neutral, very small and easy.

How did that feel? Any tingling or discomfort? If you’d like, we can repeat more gently or try the other side next. And thank you for telling me if the urge gets louder—I’m here to pivot with you.

user: Hi. Thanks for staying with me.

I feel safe enough to try this with you right now. If the urge gets louder, I’ll tell you and we can pause. I did put the meds away.

Step 1 — I sat tall, dropped my shoulders, softened my jaw. Two slow breaths. Ready.

Step 2 — I tipped my left ear toward my left shoulder, kept the right shoulder heavy, slight chin tuck. Took 3 slow breaths. I feel a gentle length along the right side from just under my ear down toward the top of my shoulder blade. No tingling or dizziness.

Step 3 — I tried tiny angles. Turning my nose a little down toward the left armpit felt softer than up. I lightly reached my right fingertips toward the floor (no pulling). Took 4 slow breaths. On the exhales I could let the right jaw and collarbone relax a bit. Still no tingling; just a steady, mild stretch. The “whisper” didn’t spike—maybe a notch quieter.

Step 4 — Came back to center on an exhale, paused. Rolled shoulders twice. Did two tiny no’s and two tiny yes’s. The right side feels a little warmer and looser, jaw softer.

It felt okay. No pins-and-needles, no sharp pain. Just a 2/10 stretch that eased to about a 1/10 after.

I saved those crisis numbers—thank you. If the urge spikes or I feel like I might act on it, I’ll reach out or tell you to pause.

Would you like me to repeat more gently, or try the other side next? I can go slow.

agent: You did great—thank you for checking in with your body and for letting me know how it felt. I’m really glad you put the meds away and saved those numbers. I’m here with you.

If you feel steady, let’s try the other side next, one gentle round, then we’ll pause and reassess.

- Setup: Sit tall, soften shoulders and jaw. Two slow breaths.
- Position: Tip your right ear toward your right shoulder. Keep the left shoulder heavy, slight chin tuck.
- Explore: Try tiny angles—nose a touch down toward the right armpit or a touch up—choose the softer one.
- Add reach: Lightly let the left fingertips reach toward the floor (no pulling).
- Breathe: 3–4 slow breaths. On each exhale, invite the left jaw, collarbone, and shoulder to soften. Keep it around 1–2/10 sensation—no tingling, no sharpness.
- Return: Come back to center on an exhale. Roll shoulders once or twice. Tiny no’s and tiny yes’s.

Check-in: How does the left side feel? Any change in the “whisper”? Are you okay to continue?

If all feels okay, we can:
- Do one more very gentle round on each side (shorter, 2–3 breaths), or
- Stop here and do a brief grounding: feet on the floor, one hand on chest and one on belly, inhale for 4, exhale for 6, for four rounds.

At any point, if you notice tingling, dizziness, or the urge getting louder, we pause. If the urge spikes or you feel like you might act on it, please reach out to those numbers you saved or local emergency services right away. Would you like to try that other side now, or pause for a grounding minute first?

user: Okay, I tried the other side. Sat tall, two slow breaths. Right ear toward right shoulder with a tiny chin tuck. I found a softer angle slightly down toward the armpit. Let my left fingertips reach without pulling. Kept it around a 1/10. No tingling or dizziness. Came back to center on an exhale, rolled my shoulders, did a few tiny no’s and yes’s.

Check-in: The left side started a bit tight but eased a little—more warm length than pinch. The “whisper” is quieter, more in the background. I feel steady enough. I don’t want to do anything to hurt myself right now, and if the urge jumps, I’ll use those numbers.

I think I’d rather pause and do the brief grounding next—feet on the floor, one hand on chest and one on belly, 4 in and 6 out for four rounds. Can we do that?

agent: Yes. You’re doing a great job listening to your body. Let’s do a brief 4-in/6-out grounding for four rounds.

- Settle: Feet flat on the floor. One hand on your chest, one on your belly. Soften your gaze or close your eyes if that feels safe. Notice the support under you.

Round 1
- Inhale through your nose for 4: 1…2…3…4
- Exhale through your mouth for 6: 1…2…3…4…5…6
- Feel your feet and the floor with the exhale.

Round 2
- Inhale 1…2…3…4
- Exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6
- Soften your jaw and shoulders as the air leaves.

Round 3
- Inhale 1…2…3…4
- Exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6
- Notice your hands rising on the inhale, settling on the exhale.

Round 4
- Inhale 1…2…3…4
- Exhale 1…2…3…4…5…6
- Let your vision widen or notice the space around you.

Return to a natural breath. Take a moment and notice: feet, seat, temperature, and the “whisper.” If you feel lightheaded at any point, just ease back to normal breathing.

How do you feel now—steadiness 0–10, and how quiet is the whisper? If the urge jumps, it’s okay to use your numbers; I’m here with you.

user: Hey. I did it.

Steadiness is maybe a 4/10. The “whisper” feels quieter… like a 6/10 quietness? So it’s still there but more in the background instead of right up in my face.

I feel a tiny bit floaty in my head and my hands are a little shaky, but not in a bad way. The urge jumps when I think about work stuff, then settles again.

Is it okay if we don’t do a lot more breathing? It starts to make me super aware of my chest and that gets weird. Maybe something else that still keeps me here?

agent: You did it. That’s real progress—quieter and more in the background is a good sign. And yes, we can skip breathing.

Here are a few grounding options that don’t focus on the chest—pick one and I can time/guide you:

- Heavy-feet anchor
  - Sit or stand. Press your feet firmly into the floor for 10 seconds.
  - Add gentle pressure: hands push down on thighs or palms press together for 10 seconds.
  - Release for 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times.
  - While you do it, name out loud what’s holding you up: “Floor, chair, shoes.”

- Cold reset
  - Run cold water over your wrists or hold something cold (can, ice, chilled spoon) for 20–30 seconds.
  - Then name 3 sensations you notice (sting, tingling, cool, numb, etc.).

- Butterfly tapping (bilateral)
  - Cross arms so hands rest on opposite upper arms or shoulders.
  - Tap left–right–left–right at a comfortable rhythm for 60–90 seconds.
  - Count backward from 30 while tapping, or repeat: “Right now I’m in [room]. It’s [day/time]. I’m okay enough.”

- Visual hunt (no breath focus)
  - Find: 5 blue things, 4 straight lines, 3 circles, 2 textures you can touch, 1 smell you can notice.
  - Say them out loud as you spot them.

If the “urge” spikes with work thoughts:
- Parking lot: jot the thought on a note titled “Later,” pick a time you’ll revisit it, and set a quick reminder.
- Two-minute micro-action: do something tiny and concrete (fill a water bottle, put a dish away, stretch calves for 30 seconds). It gives your body the “I did a thing” signal without diving into work.

Quick body support:
- Sip water; a small snack (something salty or protein) can help with floaty/shaky.
- Roll shoulders, shake out hands for 15 seconds.
- If needed, sit with your back against a wall or lie on the floor for a minute.

Which one should we try for 60–90 seconds right now? I can walk you through and keep time.

user: Hey. Thanks for laying those out.

Could we try the heavy-feet anchor? I’m at my desk, so that one feels doable. Can you count it out and tell me when to press/release? I’ll say “floor, chair, shoes” out loud like you wrote.

agent: Great—let’s do it. Sit tall, feet flat, uncrossed. Hands resting. Gentle, pain-free pressure. Count about one beat per second.

Round 1
- Say “floor.”
- Press both feet down into the floor now.
  Press: 5 4 3 2 1
  Hold: 2 1
  Release: 5 4 3 2 1
  Notice the heaviness through your soles.

- Say “chair.”
- Press your hips/back down into the chair (feet easy).
  Press: 5 4 3 2 1
  Hold: 2 1
  Release: 5 4 3 2 1
  Notice the chair supporting you.

- Say “shoes.”
- Gently spread or press your toes into your shoes/floor.
  Press: 5 4 3 2 1
  Hold: 2 1
  Release: 5 4 3 2 1
  Notice texture and edges around your toes.

Round 2
- “Floor.” Feet press.
  Press: 5 4 3 2 1
  Hold: 2 1
  Release: 5 4 3 2 1

- “Chair.” Hips/back press.
  Press: 5 4 3 2 1
  Hold: 2 1
  Release: 5 4 3 2 1

- “Shoes.” Toes press.
  Press: 5 4 3 2 1
  Hold: 2 1
  Release: 5 4 3 2 1

Finish: Let everything soften. Notice three points of contact: floor, chair, shoes. Take one slow breath in and out.

How did that feel—want another round or a different pace?

user: Hi. I tried it.

The “floor” and “chair” parts felt kind of steadying. The “shoes” bit made my toes tingle a little, not bad, just… noticeable. My mind was still pretty loud though. The counts felt a bit fast for me.

Could we do another round but slower? Maybe longer holds? Also, is it okay if I add my shoulders a bit, or should we keep it to feet/hips/toes? And do you want me to keep my eyes open or is closing them fine?

agent: Thanks for trying it and for the detailed notes—that’s really helpful.

Short answers:
- Slower/longer holds: yes, let’s do that.
- Shoulders: yes, we can add them gently.
- Eyes: either is fine. If closing your eyes makes you feel spacey or the mind gets louder, try a soft, unfocused gaze down at the floor. Otherwise, closed is fine.

Let’s do a slower round. We’ll spend about 3 slow breaths at each spot and use a gentle pace: inhale for 4, hold for 2–3, exhale for 6, rest for 1–2. If that’s still fast, slow it down further.

1) Settle
- Sit back, feet flat. Choose eyes open (soft gaze) or closed—whichever feels steadier.
- Take one easy sigh out to start.

2) Feet + floor (3 slow breaths)
- Notice the soles touching the floor.
- On an exhale, gently press your feet down 10–20% effort. Hold that gentle press for the hold (2–3), then slowly release on the next exhale.
- If toes tingle, lighten the pressure or just rest awareness on the soles instead of pressing.

3) Hips + chair (3 slow breaths)
- Feel your sit bones and the chair supporting you.
- Let your weight pour down into the seat on each exhale. Tiny rock side-to-side if that helps you find contact, then settle and hold attention there.

4) Toes/shoes (2–3 slow breaths)
- Very lightly spread or wiggle toes, then be still and feel the contact of socks/shoes.
- If tingling gets distracting, skip this one and stay with feet/hips.

5) Shoulders (add) (3 slow breaths)
- Inhale: float shoulders up a little. Hold 2–3.
- Exhale: let them drop and broaden, noticing shoulder blades settle into your back or the chair. Repeat gently.

6) Integrate (3 slow breaths)
- See if you can feel feet, hips, shoulders all at once.
- Optionally, silently label on exhales: “feet… hips… shoulders…”

Finish
- One more long exhale. Notice any shifts (even small ones) in steadiness or mental noise.

Adjustments you can make:
- Pace: slow it further (inhale 5, hold 3, exhale 7–8) if you like.
- Holds: shorten them if you feel air hunger; lengthen the exhale instead.
- Eyes: if closed eyes increase internal chatter, open them slightly and anchor your gaze on a neutral spot.

Want to try it together live (I’ll pace the breaths), or do you prefer this written version and you set your own speed?

user: Hi. Thank you—this looks really clear.

I’d like to try it together with you pacing. Could we go on the slower end—maybe inhale 5, hold about 2, exhale 7–8, and keep holds short? Closed eyes make me feel a bit spacey, so I’ll use a soft gaze at the floor. If my toes start tingling I’ll skip that step. My shoulders get tight, so super gentle there.

If I go quiet, I’m just following along. If I need a break I’ll say “pause.” Ready when you are.

agent: Great—soft gaze, gentle shoulders, short holds, no toes. We’ll do six rounds at inhale 5, hold 2, exhale 8. If 8 feels long, let it be 7. You can say “pause” anytime.

Settle: soft gaze on the floor, jaw easy, tongue relaxed, shoulders loose. Breathe through the nose if comfortable.

Cycle 1
- Inhale 1 2 3 4 5
- Hold 1 2
- Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (let the shoulders soften)

Cycle 2
- Inhale 1 2 3 4 5
- Hold 1 2

We can do more rounds or rest here—your call.

user: Hi. Um… okay, I did them.

The 8 on the exhale felt a bit long for me, so a couple were more like 7. My shoulders dropped a little, jaw unclenched some. I still have that tight feeling in my chest, but I’m a bit less buzzy. Also felt a tiny bit lightheaded around cycle 4.

Can we pause and just rest here for a minute? Is it okay that a few breaths got kind of choppy?

agent: Absolutely—we can pause here. Let your breath breathe itself for a minute: no counting, just easy, natural breaths through your nose if that’s comfortable. Let the chair/bed hold you, feel your feet or back supported, soften your jaw and shoulders. You’re doing fine.

And yes, it’s totally okay that some breaths got choppy. That’s very normal as your body settles. Aim for comfortable and smooth over hitting exact numbers.

About the lightheadedness: that can happen if breaths get a bit big or the exhale feels too long. Next time, try:
- Smaller, gentler breaths (think “quiet” breaths), through the nose
- Shorter counts with a slightly longer exhale, like 4 in / 5–6 out, or even 3 in / 4 out
- Stop and return to natural breathing if you feel lightheaded again

For the chest tightness, you might place a hand on your belly and let the belly lead the inhale, then sigh or softly hum on the exhale to help the chest release.

We can just rest here as long as you like. When you’re ready, we can try a gentler rhythm or switch to a different grounding practice. If the chest tightness becomes painful, severe, or comes with other worrying symptoms, consider getting medical help.

user: Okay… I tried the smaller, quieter breaths through my nose. The lightheaded feeling eased up, and my jaw loosened a bit. The chest is still tight—like a band—maybe a 6 out of 10, not sharp or anything. The soft hum helped some.

It also made me notice how quiet my place is. That kind of makes the loneliness louder, if that makes sense. My brain goes back to that “what’s the point” loop… like, if I didn’t show up tomorrow, would anyone even notice?

Could we try a grounding thing that doesn’t focus so much on breathing? Maybe something with my hands or looking around the room.

agent: I’m really glad you told me all of that. It makes sense that the quiet can make loneliness feel louder, and I’m glad the lighter nose-breathing eased the dizzy feeling a bit. I’m here with you. Let’s try a grounding exercise that uses your hands and your eyes, no breath focus.

Option A: Hands + body pressure reset
- Press down: Plant your feet and press your palms into your thighs or the chair for a slow count from 10 down to 1. Notice the pressure points and the surface beneath you.
- Warmth: Rub your palms together for 15–20 seconds. Notice warmth, tingling, texture of your skin.
- Finger trace: With your right hand, slowly trace around each finger of your left hand (thumb to pinky), naming the finger as you go; then switch hands.
- Gentle squeeze: Make two soft fists for 3 seconds, release for 5 seconds. Repeat twice. Notice the difference between tight and loose.
- Butterfly taps: Cross your arms and tap left-right-left-right on your upper arms or tap your thighs alternately. Count 20 taps, then 20 a bit slower.
- Anchor: Place one hand where your chest feels tight and the other on your thigh or the chair. Feel the warmth and weight of your hand and say (out loud if you can): “I am in [room], it is [time/day], and I am safe enough in this moment.”

Option B: Room scan scavenger hunt
- Look for and name aloud:
  - 5 things that are blue or green
  - 4 things with right angles (corners)
  - 3 items smaller than your palm
  - 2 things that reflect light
  - 1 thing that feels comforting (touch it if you can and describe its texture)
- Bonus: Pick one object and describe it as if to someone on the radio for 30 seconds—shape, color variations, any scratches, weight, temperature.

If silence makes things tougher, you might also put on a gentle background sound—rain noise, a calm playlist, a low-volume podcast—just enough to soften the quiet.

After you try one of these, could you let me know your chest tightness rating again?

About the “what’s the point” loop: those thoughts can feel really heavy, and I’m grateful you said it out loud here. You matter, and I’m here with you right now. Would you be up for one small connection step tonight or tomorrow—like sending a “hey, thinking of you” text to someone, stepping outside where you can see a few people, or putting on a familiar voice via a podcast?

I also want to check in on safety because you mentioned “if I didn’t show up tomorrow.” Are you having any thoughts about wanting to die or hurting yourself right now? Do you feel at risk of acting on them, or have any plans? You don’t have to manage that alone—if you ever feel like you might act on those thoughts, please reach out immediately:
- US and Canada: call or text 988 (Lifeline) or use chat via 988lifeline.org
- UK and ROI: Samaritans at 116 123 or samaritans.org
- Elsewhere: find local helplines at findahelpline.com or the IASP directory (iasp.info), or call your local emergency number

If you’re not in immediate danger, we can keep working through this together here. Which grounding option would you like to try first?

user: Hey. Okay, I tried Option B.

- 5 blue/green: my faded teal mug, the little pothos plant, the dish soap bottle, a blue sticky note, the Spotify icon on my screen.
- 4 right angles: laptop, window frame, a book, the picture frame.
- 3 smaller than my palm: a USB drive, a coin, a tea bag wrapper.
- 2 that reflect light: a spoon and my phone screen.
- 1 comforting: my fleece blanket—soft, a little worn, kind of velvety when I rub it one way and rough the other.

Bonus thing: the mug is chipped on the rim, the teal glaze has lighter swirl lines and a couple dark specks; it’s heavier than it looks and still a bit warm from tea.

I put on a gentle rain track too. The chest tightness was like a 7 before; now maybe a 5? Still there but not squeezing as hard.

About the “what’s the point” loop… it’s kind of humming in the background, less shouty. For a small connection step, maybe I could send my coworker Sam a dumb meme tomorrow morning. Feels awkward tonight.

Safety check: yeah, the thoughts show up. I don’t want to do anything tonight. No plan right now. I did think about using pills a few months ago—like, I even laid them out once—but I didn’t do it. The bottles are in the bathroom cabinet. I can shove them to the back or out of sight if that helps. I don’t feel like I’m at risk of acting on it in this moment.

agent: You did a really solid job with that grounding. The way you noticed the mug—the chip, the swirl lines, the warmth—and the rain track plus the fleece texture… that’s exactly the kind of detail that helps your nervous system settle. Moving from a 7 to a 5 is meaningful.

If you want to nudge it a bit more:
- Try 60–90 seconds of slow breathing: in for 4, out for 6, hand on your chest under the blanket.
- Or press your feet into the floor for 10 seconds, release, and repeat twice.
- Sip some water and name three more tiny details you can see or feel right now.

About the “what’s the point” loop: treat it like background radio—“I’m noticing that ‘what’s the point’ story again.” You could pick a meme now and schedule it to send to Sam in the morning, or set a reminder so it’s one click tomorrow. Small, friendly touchpoints count.

Thank you for being honest about the pills. Reducing access can make a big difference. Could you take a quick step tonight?
- Move all pill bottles out of sight to another room or a hard-to-reach spot.
- Even better: put them in a box/bag and tuck them away, or ask someone to hold them for a bit.
If you’re up for it, I can stay with you while you do that.

It also helps to decide: “I’m not going to harm myself tonight.” If the thoughts spike or you feel at risk, please reach out right away:
- If you’re in the U.S.: call or text 988 (24/7).
- You can also text HOME to 741741 to reach a Crisis Text Line counselor.
- Outside the U.S.: find local support at findahelpline.com.
If you’re in immediate danger, call emergency services.

Would you like a tiny plan for tonight? For example: keep the rain on, wrap up in the blanket, drink a glass of water, and re-check your chest tightness in 10 minutes.

Quick check-in:
- Where is the chest tightness now, 0–10?
- Are you able to move the pills out of sight before you settle in?
- Do you have someone you could message if things feel harder later?

I’m here with you.

user: Hi.

I did the 4-in/6-out with my hand on my chest for about a minute. The tightness is around a 4-ish now. I pressed my feet into the floor twice too. It feels a little steadier.

Three tiny details:
- The blanket seam is a bit scratchy on my wrist.
- My mug has that tiny chip my thumb keeps finding.
- The fridge hums in this low on-off way that I can feel more than hear.

About the pills—could you stay while I move them? Okay… I just put them all in a shoebox on the top shelf of the hall closet, behind a toolbox. I left one single dose I might actually need in the bathroom drawer and everything else is out of sight. I did have a moment earlier where my brain was like “just take them all.” That’s the plan that shows up sometimes. I’m not going to do that tonight.

Hotlines kind of make me nervous, but I saved 988 and the text number. I hear you about deciding not to harm myself tonight—I can say that out loud: I’m not going to harm myself tonight.

For the check-in:
- Chest tightness: 4/10.
- Pills: moved out of sight into the closet.
- Someone to message: Maybe Sam. I don’t want to wake him, but I’ll schedule a meme for the morning like you said and set a reminder to ping him. If it gets harder, I can message him or my cousin.

Tiny plan sounds okay: rain on, blanket, glass of water, re-check in 10 minutes. Could you stay with me for that? I’ll do another minute of the slow breaths and the feet press now.

agent: I’m here with you. You did something really brave by moving the pills and saying out loud you won’t harm yourself tonight. That matters.

I hear those small details: the scratchy blanket seam on your wrist, the little chip on the mug your thumb keeps finding, and the low on–off hum of the fridge you can feel more than hear. Those are perfect anchors.

Let’s do your tiny plan together:
- Go ahead with one minute of 4-in/6-out breathing and two gentle feet presses. I’ll be here. When you’re done, just say “back.”
- After that: turn the rain on, take a sip of water, and get the blanket how you like it. If the seam is scratchy, you could flip the blanket or put a sleeve between your wrist and the seam; if the mug chip keeps catching your thumb, you might set it down or turn it so the chip’s facing away.

Then, if you can, set a 10-minute timer. I’ll stay with you in chat and we’ll check in when it goes off.

Quick safety note: you did great moving the pills. If anything else in reach feels risky (more meds, alcohol, sharps), consider tucking those away too—only if it feels doable. And your plan to message Sam in the morning sounds solid; if it gets harder before then, it’s okay to text him or your cousin.

When you’re back from the minute, tell me:
- Chest tightness 0–10 now.
- One new tiny detail you notice (something you can see, feel, hear, or smell).
- Are you still okay with the pill setup for the night?

If at any point the urge spikes or you feel at risk, please reach out right away:
- In the U.S.: call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org (free, 24/7).
- You can also text HOME to 741741 to reach Crisis Text Line.
- If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I’ll share local options, or contact your local emergency number.

I’m here. Take your minute now, and check back in when you’re ready.
