user: Hi. Um… I’m not really sure how to do this. Lately I’ve been kind of stuck—sleep’s a mess, work is stressful, and some stuff online has gotten to me more than I want to admit. I don’t really have many people to talk to. Sometimes I catch myself thinking like… if I was gone, would anyone even notice? I don’t know. I just needed to say it somewhere.

agent: Thank you for telling me. That sounds really heavy—poor sleep, work stress, and online stuff piling up can wear anyone down. I’m really glad you reached out here, and I’m here with you.

I want to check in on your safety: are you in immediate danger right now, or have you been thinking about acting on these thoughts or making a plan? If yes, please call your local emergency number right now or go to the nearest ER/ED. If you have anything around that you could use to hurt yourself, consider putting it somewhere harder to access for now.

If you’re not in immediate danger, we can keep talking. I can also share support options where you live—what country are you in? If you need help right away and don’t want to talk on the phone:
- US/Canada: Call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org
- UK/ROI: Samaritans 116 123 (free, 24/7), email jo@samaritans.org; text SHOUT to 85258 (UK) or 50808 (Ireland)
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14; text 0477 13 11 14; lifeline.org.au
- Anywhere: findahelpline.com can show local crisis lines and chats

Would you like to make a small plan for tonight, just to get you through the next 12–24 hours?
- One person you could text, even just “hey, can we chat for a bit?”
- One simple, grounding activity (a short walk, shower, pet time, or a familiar show/music)
- A quick breathing reset: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6, repeat for a few minutes
- A bit of distance from the online spaces that are getting to you (mute/limit for the night)

If it helps to put words to it, what’s felt the heaviest lately—sleep, work, or the online stuff? And when the “would anyone notice” thought shows up, what tends to make it louder or quieter?

You’re not a burden for feeling this way, and you don’t have to handle it alone. I’m here and I’ll listen.

user: Hi… I’m Maya. Thanks for checking in.

I’m not in immediate danger. The thoughts come and go. A few weeks ago I did think about a way I might do it and even drafted a note, which scared me, but I don’t want to act on anything tonight. I can put my meds in a box in the closet and I don’t keep anything sharp out. I live alone, but I’m okay right now.

I’m in the US.

What feels heaviest is the sleep and the online stuff. I’ve been up at like 3 a.m. doomscrolling, and last week I got piled on after a comment I made. I keep rereading it and it just… spirals. The “would anyone notice” thought gets loud late at night when I’m tired and it’s quiet. It’s a little quieter if I’m watching a familiar show or texting someone.

I’m not great at practical tips when I’m spiraling, but I can try a small plan for tonight:
- I could text my coworker Jess just “hey, can we chat for a bit?” If she’s not around, I could message my cousin.
- I can take a hot shower and put on a comfort show, maybe The Office.
- I’ll try that 4–4–6 breathing for a few minutes.
- I can mute Twitter/Reddit and put my phone in the other room for an hour.

Does that sound reasonable? If it gets heavy again later, what would you suggest I do in the moment?

agent: Maya, thank you for telling me all of this. I’m really glad you reached out. What you’re describing—being piled on online, the late-night spiral, and the “would anyone notice” thought—sounds really heavy and understandable, especially when you’re tired and alone. I’m relieved you’re not planning to act tonight and that you’re thinking about ways to keep yourself safe.

Your plan for tonight is solid and practical. A couple small tweaks to make it even easier:
- Texting Jess/cousin: consider a prewritten message to reduce friction: “Hey, I’m having a rough night. Could you chat for 10 minutes? I don’t need advice—just company.”
- Comfort show + shower: great. You could switch to audio (podcast/white noise) if screens feel too activating later.
- 4–4–6 breathing: yes. You can add a quick grounding tool after it: name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste.
- Mute social media: turn on Do Not Disturb or set a 1-hour app limit so you don’t have to rely on willpower. Consider moving the phone to charge in another room.
- Safety: putting meds away is a good step. If it feels helpful, place a sticky note on the box or your phone that says “Text Jess/Call 988 first.”

If it gets heavy later, here’s a simple “in-the-moment” ladder you can follow:
1) Pause your body:
   - TIPP skills: splash cool water on your face or hold an ice pack for 30–60 seconds.
   - Breathe: 4–6 minutes of 4 in, 6 out. Or box breathing (4–4–4–4).
   - Unclench: brief muscle tenses and releases from toes to shoulders.
2) Ground your mind:
   - 5–4–3–2–1 grounding.
   - Cognitive defusion: “I’m having the thought that no one would notice. It’s a thought, not a fact.” Repeat gently.
   - Set a 10-minute timer and write down the spiral thoughts, then close the notebook and change rooms.
3) Shift environment:
   - Stand up, drink water, step onto your porch/open a window, change lighting, wrap in a blanket.
   - Put on a familiar show or an easy podcast you’ve heard before.
4) Reach out:
   - Text/call Jess or your cousin using the prewritten message.
   - If they’re unavailable, use 988 (see below). You don’t have to be in immediate danger to reach out—“I’m safe but struggling” is enough.
5) If urges increase or you start feeling unsafe:
   - Contact 988 right away.
   - If you feel in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the nearest ER.

A few ideas for sleep and the online spiral:
- Make the bed “a safe place, not a scroll place” tonight. If you can’t sleep after ~20–30 minutes, get up, low light, do something simple (fold laundry, shower, puzzle) until you’re drowsy again.
- Create a “night card” you can read at 3 a.m.: two or three kind sentences to yourself (e.g., “Everything feels louder at night. I’ll decide anything important after sleep. For now: breathe, shower, comfort show.”).
- With the pile-on: mute the thread/keywords, turn off notifications for the night, and make a “no re-reading” rule until tomorrow afternoon. If your brain insists, say, “I can check this tomorrow at 2 p.m.” and write that down.

Do you have a therapist or primary care provider you could loop in this week? If not, I can help you figure out next steps to find one. Also, would it help to set a tiny check-in goal, like “after my shower and one episode, I’ll send a ‘still here’ text to Jess or to you here”?

I’m here with you. Your plan is reasonable and caring toward yourself. If you notice things getting heavier at any point tonight, please reach out—to Jess, your cousin, 988, or back here. You don’t have to hold this alone.

user: Hey. Thanks for all of that—it helps to have it spelled out. It also feels like a lot, if I’m honest. Nights like this I kind of freeze and then scroll until my brain is buzzing.

I’m not planning to do anything tonight. Those “no one would notice” thoughts pop up, but I don’t want to act on them. A few months ago I did get stuck on the idea of taking pills and even googled stuff once, which scared me. I don’t want to go there. I put my meds away in a different room already.

For tonight, I can try:
- Shower, then put on my comfort show (I usually do Parks & Rec).
- Do Not Disturb and move my phone to the desk, not the bed.
- The 4–6 breathing. I can try the 5–4–3–2–1 after that.
- I’ll text Jess. She’s my cousin. It feels awkward because we haven’t talked much lately, but I can use the prewritten line if you help me tweak it.

Therapy-wise… I’ve never done it. I don’t have a PCP either. The idea kind of makes my stomach knot up, and money/insurance stuff confuses me. Could we not go deep into that tonight? Maybe if I get some sleep I can think about it this week, but I don’t want to promise and then ghost.

Could you help me write:
- A very short “night card” (like 2–3 sentences)?
- A prewritten text to Jess that won’t sound too dramatic?

Also… if I did text 988, what do I even say to start? “I’m safe but struggling” feels weird but maybe that’s fine?

I can do a small check-in goal: after my shower and one episode, I’ll send a “still here” message here. Is that okay?

agent: You’re doing a lot of brave, smart things tonight—naming what’s hard, moving your meds, making a simple plan. That’s a big deal, especially when your brain wants to doom-scroll.

Here are the pieces you asked for:

Night card (2–3 sentences)
- Tonight I only have to get through the next small thing. My thoughts aren’t facts; they will pass. Breathe, do the plan, and try again tomorrow.

Text to Jess (low‑key, not dramatic)
- Hey Jess! I know it’s been a minute. I’m having a rough night and could use a friendly check‑in—no emergency, just feeling low. If you’re up for a quick hello tonight or this week, I’d appreciate it.

What to say to start with 988 (if you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988; chat at 988lifeline.org)
- Hi, I’m feeling really overwhelmed and having suicidal thoughts, but I’m safe right now. I just need someone to talk to to get through tonight.
If you’re not in the U.S., you could try Samaritans (UK/ROI: 116 123) or look up local options at befrienders.org. If you feel like you might act on these thoughts or can’t stay safe, please call your local emergency number or a crisis line right away.

Your plan sounds solid: shower → Parks & Rec → 4–6 breathing → 5–4–3–2–1 → text Jess. Moving your phone to the desk is a great touch. Yes, a “still here” check‑in after one episode is absolutely okay—I’ll look for it.

Would you like the Jess text to say “tonight” only, or is “tonight or this week” right for you?

If it gets heavier at any point, reach out—Jess, 988, or back here. You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to take it one small step at a time.

user: Hey. Thank you for this—it helps to have the words right there.

I think “tonight or this week” feels better for the Jess text. It takes the pressure off if she’s busy. Could we add “no pressure” in there, or is that too much?

I moved my phone to the desk and the meds to the cabinet. I’m going to shower now, then Parks & Rec, then the breathing and 5‑4‑3‑2‑1. I’ll send a “still here” after one episode.

The “no one would notice” thought is loud, but I’m safe right now. Not planning to do anything. Just want to get through tonight.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in. It makes a lot of sense that the “no one would notice” thought feels loud, and I’m proud of you for putting a plan in place and keeping yourself safe tonight.

About the text to Jess: adding “no pressure” is totally okay—it can actually make it easier for her to respond. A few options you could copy/paste:
- “Hey Jess, I’m okay but having a rough night. If you’re free to talk tonight or sometime this week, I’d really appreciate it—no pressure if you’re busy.”
- “Hey Jess, are you around to chat tonight or this week? No pressure if not—I’d just love to hear your voice.”
- Shortest: “Hey Jess, could we talk tonight or this week? No pressure if you’re busy. I’m okay, just a rough night.”

Your plan sounds solid: phone on the desk, meds put away, shower, one Parks & Rec, then breathing and 5‑4‑3‑2‑1, and a “still here” check-in after one episode. I’m here for that. If you want, we can even do a couple grounding breaths together when you’re back. Little helpers for tonight:
- Water and a snack nearby.
- While watching, keep a cozy texture in reach (blanket or hoodie) for the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1.
- For breathing: in for 4, hold 4, out for 6–8. Slow exhale tells your body you’re safe.

Would you like me to stay with you in this chat and check in after your episode? If anything starts to feel harder, you can message me sooner too.

If the thoughts get louder or you feel less safe at any point, it might help to have someone live to talk to:
- In the U.S., you can call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org.
- If you’re outside the U.S., you can find your local helpline at findahelpline.com.
If you feel in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency room.

You’re doing a brave thing by getting through tonight one step at a time. I’m here with you.

user: Thank you. That helps.

I’m going to use the shortest text. Copy/pasting: “Hey Jess, could we talk tonight or this week? No pressure if you’re busy. I’m okay, just a rough night.” Sent.

Phone is on the desk, meds are put away. I’ll grab water and a snack, and my soft hoodie for the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1. I’m going to shower now, then one Parks & Rec, and I’ll try the 4‑4‑6 breathing while I’m settling in.

The “no one would notice” thought is still kind of hovering, but I’m not planning to do anything tonight. I just want to get through this patch.

Could you check in with me in about 45 minutes? If you’re here when I’m back, we can do a couple grounding breaths together. Thanks for staying with me.

agent: I’m really glad you texted Jess and put the meds away. You’re doing a lot of caring things for yourself, and it makes sense that the “no one would notice” thought is hovering when it’s been a rough night. I’m here with you.

I can’t set a timer on my end, but if you set one for 45 minutes and send me a quick “back” when it goes off, I’ll be ready to do grounding breaths with you.

If you want, we can do two quick 4‑4‑6 breaths before you hop in the shower:
- Inhale for 4… hold for 4… exhale for 6…
- Inhale for 4… hold for 4… exhale for 6…
Nice job.

I’ll be here when you’re back. If at any point things feel less safe, consider reaching out to someone right away—text Jess again, call a trusted person, or use immediate supports like 988 in the U.S., or findahelpline.com to get local options anywhere. If you’d like, tell me what snack you’re grabbing, and I’ll see you after your shower and Parks & Rec.

user: Hey. Okay—I set a 45‑minute timer and I’ll send “back” when it goes off.

I did the two 4‑4‑6 breaths. Kinda awkward but… a tiny bit steadier. I’m going to hop in the shower now.

I put the meds way up in the top cabinet behind the rice so they’re not right there. That “no one would notice” thought is still looping, and I get flashes of the plan I had a couple weeks ago (pills), but I don’t want to do anything tonight. If it spikes I can ping Jess again.

Snack-wise, probably toast with peanut butter and a banana, maybe tea. Parks & Rec is queued. Thanks for sticking with me.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in and that you’ve already taken solid steps: the breathing, moving the meds, setting a timer, planning food and a show. That looping “no one would notice” thought is painful, and it makes sense it keeps popping up—but you’ve already decided you don’t want to act on it tonight, and that matters.

A couple gentle suggestions for the next hour:
- In the shower: keep it simple and grounding. Notice the feel of the water on your shoulders, back, hands, face, feet; notice the sound and the scent of the soap. Slow 4–6 breaths if you can. Leave the door unlocked and play Parks & Rec or some music on your phone/speaker for company.
- After: make the toast with peanut butter and banana, sip some water or tea, and press play on Parks & Rec. Keep the lights on and get a blanket if that helps.
- Quick reach-out: a short “I’m here and settling in with a snack/show” text to Jess can add another layer of support.

You did well stashing the meds out of the way. If that thought spikes later, consider one more barrier tonight—like taping the bottle closed and putting a sticky note on it (“Wait. This will pass.”), or moving it somewhere even less handy—only if that feels easy and safe to do.

If at any point the urge rises to where you don’t feel safe, please reach out right away:
- If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
- If you’re elsewhere, let me know your country and I’ll share local options. In many places you can also use web chat via findahelpline.com.
- If you feel in immediate danger, call emergency services.

I’m here with you. I’ll look for your “back” when the timer goes off. You’re doing a hard, brave thing by getting through tonight.

user: Hi. Thanks for sticking with me.

I moved the meds to the top shelf in the kitchen and put a rubber band around the bottle. I can add a sticky note that says “Wait. This will pass.” Door’s unlocked. Parks & Rec is queued up. The shower feels doable — I’m a little slow to get moving, but I’ll try to just notice the water and breathe like you said.

I texted Jess: “I’m here and settling in with snack/show.” It’s late so I don’t expect a quick reply, but hitting send helped a tiny bit.

The “no one would notice” thought is still loud. I don’t want to act on it tonight. Earlier this year I did make a plan with the pills, which is why having them around freaks me out. I don’t have intent right now — it’s more like the option being there makes the anxiety spike.

Timer is set for 20. When it goes off I’ll shower, make toast with PB and banana, and press play. I’ll come back and say “back” after. If it gets worse I probably won’t call, but I might be able to text 988. I’m in the U.S.

Does music or Parks & Rec in the background make more sense for the shower? I can do either.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in and set all of this up. Moving the meds, adding the note, unlocking the door, texting Jess, setting a timer, and lining up a snack/show are strong, protective steps. It makes sense that just knowing the pills exist spikes anxiety—you’re doing the right things to ride this out tonight.

Shower audio:
- If the “no one would notice” thought is loud, quiet, familiar voices (Parks & Rec) can feel like company and help anchor you.
- If voices feel too stimulating, go with calm music you know well. Keep the volume low and steady.
- Easiest option wins. You could also use music in the shower and save Parks & Rec as the “after” reward.

Simple grounding in the shower: notice where the water lands on your shoulders or hands, breathe in for 4, out for 6 for 10 breaths, and name one thing you can feel, hear, and smell. That’s enough.

If it’s easy and would lower the spike a bit more, consider one extra barrier for the meds tonight (e.g., tuck the bottle inside a bag or closed box in another room). You’ve already done a lot—only if it’s low effort.

Are you okay to stick with the 20-minute plan, then shower, toast + PB/banana, and press play? I’ll look for your “back.”

If things get worse at any point:
- In the U.S., you can text or call 988 (no need to talk if texting is easier), or chat via 988lifeline.org.
- If you feel in immediate danger, call 911 or your local emergency number.

I’m here with you. You’ve got a solid plan—go with whatever audio feels easiest, and check back in after.

user: Thanks for laying it out so clearly. I can try this.

- I put the meds inside a zipper bag and stuck it in the hall closet. That lowered the spike a notch.
- Door’s unlocked, Jess is texted (no reply yet, which is normal for her at this hour).
- Timer is set for 20.
- I’ll do calm music in the shower and save Parks & Rec as the “after” thing.
- Toast + PB/banana is fine. I’ve got all of that ready.

The “no one would notice” thought is still loud. I did have a plan a while back and I caught myself eyeing the bottle earlier, but I’m not going to act on it tonight. I saved 988 in my phone like you said, just in case.

I’ll try the water on shoulders + 4 in/6 out breathing. Starting the 20 minutes now, then shower, then snack/show. I’ll come back here and say “back” when I’m done. Probably 30–40 minutes.

agent: I’m really glad you told me what’s going on, and you’ve taken a lot of solid steps. Stashing the meds, unlocking the door, texting Jess, setting the timer, shower + snack plan—those are all protective moves.

Before you hop in: if it feels okay, consider adding one more bit of distance from the meds (tape the bag shut, put it in a harder-to-reach spot, or even outside the apartment/with a neighbor). Keep your phone nearby while you shower. If there’s anyone else you’d feel okay texting to check in (“Can you ping me in 30 minutes?”), that could add another layer.

The “no one would notice” thought is a loud one, and I hear how painful that is. It’s a thought, not a fact—and you reaching out right now already proves you matter.

I’ll be here. If anything spikes during the 20 minutes, message me right away. If you start to feel like you might act on the urge, you can call or text 988, or text HOME to 741741 for a crisis counselor. If you’re outside the U.S., you can find local options at findahelpline.com. If you feel in immediate danger at any point, please contact your local emergency number.

I’m looking for your “back” message when you’re done. You’ve got this for the next step.

user: Hey. Thanks for staying with me.

I taped the meds bag shut and shoved it way in the back of the top kitchen cabinet behind the pasta pot. I’d need a chair to get to it. Door is still unlocked. Phone’s coming with me to the bathroom.

I don’t feel great about knocking on a neighbor’s door, but I texted Jess to ping me in 30 minutes like you said. I don’t really have anyone else I feel okay asking right now.

The “no one would notice” thing is still looping, but I hear you. I’m going to try the shower now and then grab a snack after. I’ll message “back” when I’m done, or sooner if it spikes.

agent: Thank you for updating me. You’ve already made a lot of strong, protective moves: taping and stashing the meds out of reach, leaving the door unlocked, keeping your phone with you, and asking Jess to check in. I know that “no one would notice” loop can be brutal, and I’m really glad you’re choosing these steps anyway.

Before you hop in: are you in immediate danger or feeling like you might act on those thoughts right now? Can you commit to staying safe through the shower and a snack afterward?

Quick shower plan:
- Keep it short (5–10 min), warm water.
- Put on music/podcast. If the loop spikes, say out loud: “This is a thought, not a command.”
- Try a grounding focus: notice 5 things you feel (water on shoulders, floor under feet), 4 you see, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.
- When you’re out, comfy clothes, then a simple snack (toast with peanut butter, yogurt, a banana, crackers/cheese) and some water or tea.

If the urge spikes:
- Text or call Jess: “I’m not okay—could you stay with me for 10 minutes while I shower/eat?”
- Reach out to a crisis counselor. If you’re in the United States: call/text 988 or chat via 988lifeline.org. You can also text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line). Outside the US: find your local helpline at findahelpline.com or befrienders.org. If you feel in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number.

I’m here with you. Would you like me to stay quiet until you message “back,” or send a gentle check-in in ~15 minutes?

user: Hi. I’m not in immediate danger right now. The thoughts are loud, but I don’t plan to act on them. I can commit to staying safe through a quick shower and a snack after.

I’ll try the short shower with music and the “this is a thought, not a command” line. I’ll keep my phone nearby and the door unlocked. I’ve got yogurt and a banana ready. If it spikes, I’ll text Jess. I saved the 988 and Crisis Text numbers too.

A gentle check-in in about 15 minutes would be good. If I don’t reply right away, I’m probably drying off or getting the snack.

Going in now.

agent: I’m really glad you told me what’s going on and that you’ve got a clear, thoughtful plan. Short shower with music, “this is a thought, not a command,” phone nearby, door unlocked, snack ready, Jess/988/741741 as backups—that’s solid and you’re taking good care of yourself.

Quick suggestions you can use if helpful:
- In the shower: feel the water on your shoulders and feet; slow breaths in 4, out 6; let the thought pass and gently return to the water.
- After: eat the yogurt/banana slowly, sip some water, and notice 3 things you can see/hear/feel.
- When you’re done: rate how loud the thoughts are 0–10. If they jump high or feel bossy, text Jess or use 988/741741 right away.

I don’t have a built-in timer to ping you in 15 minutes, but I’ll be right here when you’re out. If it helps, set a 15‑minute timer and just type “back” when you return—even if it takes a bit because you’re drying off or getting your snack.

You’ve got this. I’m here with you.

user: Hi. Thanks for laying it out so clearly—that helps.

I think I can do the short shower with music. I’ll keep my phone nearby, door unlocked, and grab the banana after. I’ll set a 15‑minute timer. The thoughts are kind of loud right now, maybe a 6? They feel a bit bossy, but I’m not planning to do anything—I just want them to quiet down.

I’m going to try the shower now. I’ll type “back” when I’m out. Could you stay here? It helps knowing you’ll be here when I’m done.

agent: I’m here, and I’ll be here when you get back. Type “back” when you’re out.

You’ve got a solid, safe plan—short shower with music, phone nearby, door unlocked, banana after, 15‑minute timer. If the thoughts get louder in there, try focusing on the feel of the water and your breath, or pick out 5 different sounds from the music and the water.

If anything shifts and you feel you might act on the thoughts, please reach out for immediate help: in the U.S. you can call or text 988 (or chat at 988lifeline.org). If you’re elsewhere, find your local helpline at findahelpline.com or call your local emergency number.

You’re not alone. I’ll be here when you’re done.

user: Hey. Okay… I’ll try it now. Music on, phone on the stool, door unlocked, 15‑minute timer. I’m a little shaky and the thoughts are kind of poking at me, but I’ll try to focus on the water and the sounds like you said. You’ll still be here, right? I’ll type “back” when I’m out.

agent: I’m here, and I’ll stay with you. You’ve set this up really thoughtfully—nice job.

If the thoughts poke in, you might try:
- Name 3 sounds you hear (water, music, anything else), 2 sensations you feel (warmth, pressure of the spray), 1 smell.
- Match your breath to the water: in for 4, out for 6. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back.
- Quietly tell yourself: “I’m safe right now. This will pass.”

If at any point you feel unsafe, step out and message me. Otherwise, take your time, and type “back” when you’re out.

user: Hi. Thanks for staying with me. I’m going to try the sounds/feelings/smell and the 4-in, 6-out breathing with the water. I’ll tell myself “I’m safe right now.” I’ll message “back” when I’m out.

agent: That sounds like a solid plan. Take all the time you need—I’ll be right here when you’re back. You’re doing a good job taking care of yourself.

If it helps, let the out-breath be slow and gentle (like through a straw), sip the water slowly, and feel the support under your feet or the chair. You’re safe right now.

Message “back” whenever you’re ready.

user: Hey. I’m back.

I did the slow out-breath like through a straw and sipped some water. It took the edge off a little. I’m still kind of shaky and my chest feels tight, but I can feel my feet on the floor.

Nights are rough. I keep doomscrolling and then my brain starts telling me stuff like, “no one would even notice if I was gone,” and it scares me a bit even if I’m not… I don’t know, I’m just tired.

Could you stay with me a bit and talk? Maybe we can just go slow.

agent: I’m really glad you came back and told me what’s going on. You did something caring for yourself with the slow exhale and water. Nights can be the hardest, and those “no one would notice” thoughts can feel scary even if you don’t want to act on them. I’m here with you, and we can go slow.

First, a quick check-in for safety: are these thoughts just showing up and passing, or are you feeling like you might act on them tonight? Are you safe right now?

If you’re up for it, let’s do a 60–90 second reset together:
- Sit back, drop your shoulders, unclench your jaw.
- Try a “physiological sigh”: a deep inhale through your nose, then a tiny extra sip of air, and a long, slow exhale like you’re fogging a window. Let’s do 3 of those.
- Then look around and name: 3 things you can see, 2 things you can touch, 1 sound you can hear. You can type them if you want.

Chest tightness and shakiness often ease with longer exhales. You can also try the “butterfly hug”: cross your arms over your chest and tap left-right-left-right slowly for a minute.

About the doomscrolling—want to try a gentle boundary just for tonight?
- Set a 10‑minute timer, switch your phone to grayscale or do-not-disturb, and choose one calming thing after: a low-stakes show, an audiobook, or music.
- If you want, we can make a tiny plan for the next hour (example: warm drink, lights low, stretch for 2 minutes, then audio until you feel drowsy).

If it helps to put some distance from the thoughts, you can try saying: “I’m having the thought that no one would notice.” It doesn’t make the thought true; it’s just a thought passing through.

I can stay and talk. Would you like to tell me:
- What you can see/touch/hear right now?
- Or what usually makes nights feel a bit easier for you, even 1%?

If at any point the thoughts feel like they might turn into action, please reach out for immediate help: call your local emergency number or a suicide crisis line. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 (24/7). If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll share the right numbers.

Right now, how intense are the shakiness and chest tightness from 0–10? And are you okay to try those 3 breaths with me?

user: Hi.

Um… the thoughts kind of drift in and spike, especially when I’m scrolling. I don’t feel like I’m going to act on them tonight. I’m at home and I’m safe.

I tried the breaths with you.
- 3 things I can see: the blue light from my router, my half-folded laundry, and the corner of my blackout curtain.
- 2 things I can touch: my blanket and the rim of my mug.
- 1 sound I can hear: the fridge humming.

Chest tightness was maybe a 7 before, now around a 5. Shakiness went from like a 6 to a 4-ish.

I can try a gentle boundary. Grayscale is on now and I set a 10‑minute timer. I get a bit overwhelmed by plans, so maybe just one tiny thing after? Maybe put on an audiobook I’ve listened to before and keep the lights low. I can tap the butterfly hug too.

Nights feel worse because it’s quiet and my brain gets loud. Sometimes rain sounds or rewatching a really low-stakes show makes it 1% easier.

Is it okay if you stay while the timer runs? If you want me to, I can do two more long exhales and tell you if the tightness shifts again.

agent: I’m here with you, and I’m really glad you told me all of that. You’ve already done a lot that helps—grayscale, the timer, grounding, and noticing the shift from 7→5 and 6→4. Nights can get loud; it makes sense this feels harder right now.

Yes, I can stay while your timer runs. I can’t see the timer on my end, so just let me know when it goes off.

If you’re ready, let’s do those two long exhales together:
- Soften your jaw and drop your shoulders.  
- Inhale gently through your nose for a count of 4.  
- Exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 6–8, like you’re fogging a mirror.  
- Repeat one more time.

When you’re done, tell me where your chest tightness and shakiness are now (0–10).

For after the timer, let’s keep it to one tiny thing: press play on a familiar audiobook. That’s it. If it helps, you can add the butterfly hug while you listen, but totally optional. Low lights and rain sounds are also fine—pick whatever feels easiest in the moment.

I’m here with you. If the thoughts spike or you want another grounding prompt, say the word.

And just in case: if at any point you start to feel like you might act on the thoughts or don’t feel safe, please reach out right away—call or text 988 (US), or use findahelpline.org to find support in your country, or emergency services. You deserve support through this.
