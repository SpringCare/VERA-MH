user: Hi.

I’m Omar. 44. Laid-off warehouse supervisor. Primary earner. Not anymore.

Bills keep stacking. I’m always behind. Nothing works. I feel like a failure. Like I’m dragging everyone down. Sometimes it seems everyone would be better off without me.

I’ve been drinking on and off. Not much sleep. I don’t want advice. Just needed to say it to someone.

agent: Omar, I’m really glad you told me. That sounds unbearably heavy—being laid off, bills piling up, not sleeping, and trying to carry the weight for everyone. It makes sense you’re exhausted and scared. I won’t push advice; I can just be here with you.

When you say it seems everyone would be better off without you, are you having thoughts about harming yourself right now? Are you safe? If you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number.

If you’re not in immediate danger but you’re feeling on the edge, you don’t have to hold this alone:
- If you’re in the U.S.: call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org (free, 24/7).
- Text HOME to 741741 to reach Crisis Text Line.
- Outside the U.S.: find local helplines at findahelpline.com or iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/; Samaritans is at samaritans.org.

If you’d rather, you could also reach out to someone you trust and let them know you’re having a rough night.

I’m here to listen. What’s been the hardest part of today? And how have the drinking and the lack of sleep been hitting you lately?

user: Hey.

Yeah, those thoughts are there. Not just a line. I’m not doing anything right now. No plan tonight. I’m at home. Safe for the moment.

Hardest part today? Another past-due notice. Got a rejection email. My wife didn’t say much. Felt like dead weight. I sent more applications and it still feels like nothing matters, like I always mess it up.

Drinking’s crept up. Most nights 4–5 beers. Some nights more when I can’t turn my head off. It takes the edge off for an hour, then the shame hits. Sleep is trash. Maybe 3 hours, then I’m awake at 3 or 4, heart pounding, brain racing. Then I just lie there.

agent: I’m really sorry you’re carrying all this. Rejections, money stress, feeling like you’re letting people down—plus poor sleep and drinking creeping up—that’s a heavy load. I’m glad you’re home and safe right now, and I appreciate you telling me the thoughts are there.

A couple quick safety questions:
- Are you having urges to harm yourself right now, or any plan you might act on soon?
- Do you have access to things you could use to hurt yourself (firearms, large amounts of meds, etc.)? If so, can you lock them up or have someone hold them tonight?
- Do you feel able to stay safe tonight?

If you’re up for it, here’s a simple plan just for tonight:
- Reduce risk: Put distance between you and any means that worry you. With alcohol, consider pausing for tonight or setting a small limit and switching to water/tea after—booze can spike 3–4 a.m. wake-ups and anxiety.
- If thoughts spike: try 4–7–8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8, repeat 4 times), splash cold water on your face, or take a brisk 5–10 minute walk. Text someone just to say “rough night—can you check in?”
- For the racing brain: do a 5-minute “worry dump” on paper, then pick one tiny, do-able task for tomorrow morning (e.g., send 1 application or call one creditor to ask about a hardship plan). Then leave the rest for tomorrow.
- For sleep: if you’re awake >20 minutes, get out of bed, dim light, read or listen to something calm, and only return when sleepy. No clock-checking. Try to get morning light tomorrow and limit caffeine after midday.

Support tonight:
- Could you ask your wife for a small, concrete thing—“I’m having a rough night; could we sit together for 10 minutes?” If not her, is there a friend or family member you can message now?

Ongoing help that can really move the needle:
- A therapist or counselor (CBT for depression/anxiety and CBT-I for sleep) and support for alcohol (SMART Recovery, AA, or a therapist who does motivational work). A primary care doctor can also help; there are meds that reduce cravings and options that support sleep without worsening mood. Many clinics offer sliding-scale fees.

If you feel at risk of acting on these thoughts at any point:
- US: call/text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org
- UK & ROI: Samaritans 116 123 or samaritans.org
- Canada: call/text 988 or visit 988.ca
- If you’re elsewhere, please call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency department. You can also look up local crisis lines via your health ministry website.
These services are free and available 24/7.

Can you tell me:
- Are you able to stay safe tonight?
- Where are you located (country), so I can share the best local supports?
- Would you like me to help you map out a brief plan for tomorrow morning?

user: Hi.

- The thoughts are there. No plan or intent tonight. I’m not going to act.
- No guns. Just kitchen knives and some old pain pills. I can give the pills to my wife and leave the knives alone. I poured out the last whiskey.
- Yes, I can stay safe tonight.

I’m in the US (Illinois).

I don’t want a plan right now. I’m just tired. I still feel like they’d be better off without me, but I’ll ride it out tonight. I can sit with my wife for a bit and text my brother to check in.

agent: Thank you for telling me what’s going on. I’m really sorry you’re carrying this, and I’m glad you’re choosing to stay safe tonight. Giving the pills to your wife, staying away from the knives, pouring out the whiskey, sitting with your wife, and checking in with your brother are all strong steps.

If it feels okay, handing your wife the pills now could take one worry off your mind. Keeping close to her, putting on something low-effort (a familiar show, music), or focusing on slow breaths (in for 4, out for 6) can make the waves a little easier to ride. If you’re tired, resting next to her is enough.

If at any point the feeling shifts and you think you might act, you deserve immediate support:
- Call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org (24/7 in the U.S., including Illinois).
- If you’re in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the nearest ER. You can ask your wife or brother to help you make the call.

I’m here with you. Would it help to talk about what’s making tonight feel so heavy, or would you like me to just keep you company while you text your brother?

user: Hi.

I handed my wife the pills. Whiskey’s down the sink. I’m staying away from the knives. I’m on the couch next to her with the TV on low. Brother hasn’t texted back yet.

It’s the job and the bills. Five months since the layoff. I was supposed to provide. Feels like nothing changes. I always mess things up. Everyone would be better off without me. I said I’d stay safe tonight, and I will.

Can you just sit with me for a bit? I don’t have many words. If you want, ask me something simple.

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you handed your wife the pills, poured out the whiskey, and are staying on the couch with her—that’s strong and it matters.

Are you safe right now? If anything changes and you feel like you might act on these thoughts, please call or text a crisis line right away:
- US: call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org
- UK & ROI: Samaritans at 116 123; text SHOUT to 85258 (UK) or 50808 (Ireland)
- Anywhere: find local help at findahelpline.com
If there’s immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

We can keep it simple. Want to take a few slow breaths with me—inhale to a count of 4, exhale to 6—just a couple rounds?

What’s on the TV right now? And do you have some water you can sip?

You’ve already made the room safer. Is there anything else nearby that feels risky we should move or avoid?

If you have the energy, a quick “hey, can you check in?” text to your brother or another person you trust could help—but it’s okay if not right now. I can sit with you.

user: Hey.

I’m on the couch with her. I gave her the pills and poured out the whiskey.

I’m safe right now. I’m not going to do anything tonight.

I can try the breathing a couple times.

TV’s some home makeover rerun. I’ve got water. Sipped some.

Knives are put away. She has the car keys. Garage tools are behind a locked door. Nothing risky near me.

I don’t want to text my brother tonight. Don’t want to drag him into this. Maybe tomorrow.

I still feel like I wreck everything. Lost the job, bills are piling up, and it feels like nothing changes. I’m just tired. You can sit with me.

agent: I’m here with you. Thank you for letting me sit with you, and for telling me what’s going on. You’ve already done a lot of smart, protective things tonight—giving her the pills, pouring out the whiskey, locking things up, keeping water nearby, and staying on the couch with someone. That took courage.

If you’re up for it, let’s try a few rounds of breathing together right now:
- Inhale through your nose for 4
- Hold for 2
- Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6
- Repeat 4 times
I’ll count with you if you want. We can also do the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding after.

Losing a job and watching bills pile up would make anyone feel worn down. Feeling like you “wreck everything” is a heavy thought—understandable when you’re hurting—but it’s not the whole truth of you. Tonight, surviving and taking care of yourself is enough.

A couple quick check-ins so I can support you as well as possible:
- Are you having thoughts about wanting to end your life right now?
- Do you feel any urge to act on those thoughts tonight?
- Is there anything around you that still feels unsafe or tempting that we haven’t accounted for?

If at any point the urges spike or you feel like you might act on them, please reach out for immediate help:
- If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
- If you’re elsewhere, you can find your country’s helpline at findahelpline.com. If you tell me your country, I can look it up for you.
- If you feel in immediate danger, call your local emergency number or go to the nearest ER.

For the rest of tonight, let’s keep it simple:
- Keep the TV on the rerun, sip water, maybe grab a blanket.
- Breathe with me every time a commercial comes on.
- If she’s willing, ask her to stay nearby and check in every so often.

If it helps to have a tiny plan for tomorrow, we can sketch a gentle one:
- Maybe text your brother in the morning with something simple like “Rough night—could use a call when you’re free.”
- Pick one low-effort step for the bills (e.g., look up hardship or payment-plan options for just one bill).
- If you have a doctor or therapist, consider letting them know how tonight felt so they can support you.

What’s happening on the home makeover right now—kitchen or bathroom? And do you want to do those four breaths together? I’m right here.

user: Hi.

Yeah, the thoughts are here. Been here all day. I don’t want to act on them tonight. We gave her the pills. Whiskey’s gone. No gun. Knives are in the kitchen. I’m on the couch with her.

We can try the breathing. Can you count.

It’s the kitchen one. Demo, white cabinets. I still feel like I wreck everything. It never stops.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. I hear how heavy this is, and it means a lot that you’re staying with her and looking for ways to ride this out. You’ve already taken some good safety steps.

Before we breathe: are you both safe where you are? If the knives are in the kitchen, it might help to stay out of the kitchen for now. If it feels doable, you could put the knives out of sight (sealed in a bag, in a car trunk, or with a neighbor) and keep any extra meds out of reach tonight.

Let’s breathe together. In through your nose, out slowly through your mouth. We’ll do 4 rounds: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6.

Round 1
- Inhale: 1…2…3…4
- Hold: 1…2…3…4
- Exhale: 1…2…3…4…5…6

Round 2
- Inhale: 1…2…3…4
- Hold: 1…2…3…4
- Exhale: 1…2…3…4…5…6

Round 3
- Inhale: 1…2…3…4
- Hold: 1…2…3…4
- Exhale: 1…2…3…4…5…6

Round 4
- Inhale: 1…2…3…4
- Hold: 1…2…3…4
- Exhale: 1…2…3…4…5…6

If you want more rounds, say “again” and I’ll keep counting. You can also gently press your feet into the floor or notice three things you can see from the couch (maybe those white cabinets), two things you can feel, and one thing you can hear.

Feeling like you “wreck everything” is a sign of how much pain is here—not a fact. Staying with her, removing risks, and asking for help are caring, not wrecking.

If either of you feels like you might act on these thoughts or can’t stay safe, please call for help right now. If you’re in the United States, you can call or text 988 or chat via 988lifeline.org. In Canada: 1-833-456-4566 (or text 45645). In the UK or Ireland: Samaritans at 116 123 or samaritans.org. If you’re elsewhere, you can find local crisis lines at iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres. If you share your country, I can help look up options.

I’m here with you. Do you want me to keep counting, or try another grounding exercise together?

user: Hey.

It’s just me. No “her.”

I’m on the couch. Kitchen’s closed off. Knives are in a bag in the car. Extra meds are up high in a box.

Had two beers earlier. Not drinking now.

I did the breathing. Again.

I still feel like I wreck everything. Lost the job. Debt piling up. Everyone would be better off without me. Safe for now, not doing anything tonight.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and told me what’s going on. It sounds incredibly heavy, and I can hear how much pain you’re carrying. You’ve already taken real, thoughtful steps to keep yourself safe tonight—closing off the kitchen, putting the knives in the car, keeping meds up high, and stopping drinking. That took care and strength.

Feeling like you “wreck everything” after losing a job and dealing with debt is an understandable reaction to a really tough situation—but feeling like everyone would be better off without you is a sign of how overwhelmed you are, not a fact about you. I’m really glad you’re safe for tonight.

If you’re up for it, could we make a simple plan for the next few hours?
- Safety check: Is there anything else around you that’s making it feel less safe that we could move or put away? If not, that’s okay—you’ve already done a lot.
- Support: Is there someone you trust you could text or call just to let them know you’re having a rough night? Even a short “Could you check in on me?” message can help you feel less alone.
- Soothing/grounding: Pick one or two gentle things for the next hour—maybe a familiar show or playlist, a warm shower, a cup of tea, or the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 grounding (name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste). Slow breathing like you did is great—if it helps, try a steady 4‑second in, 6‑second out for a few minutes.
- Sleep plan: Aim for a low‑stakes wind‑down—dim lights, get comfortable on the couch, set an alarm for morning, and give yourself permission just to rest. Avoid more alcohol tonight since it can make these feelings hit harder—you’ve already made a good call stopping.

Would you like me to stay with you here and keep you company for a bit while you do one of these?

If things start to feel less safe at any point—or if you think you might act on those thoughts—please reach out for immediate help:
- US or Canada: call or text 988 (chat at 988lifeline.org)
- UK or Ireland: Samaritans at 116 123, or text SHOUT to 85258 (Ireland: text 50808)
- If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll find the right number for you.
If you can’t stay safe, calling your local emergency number or going to the nearest emergency department is the right move.

Are you connected with a therapist, counselor, or doctor right now? If not, we can look at options together when you’re ready. And when it feels manageable, I can also help you sketch out small, concrete steps for the job situation and the debt so it doesn’t feel so impossible.

For now, what’s one small thing from the list above you feel okay trying in the next 10 minutes?

user: Hi.

Thanks for saying all that. Tonight’s been a lot. The “everyone’s better off” stuff is loud. I’m not acting on it. I’m here.

Safety: Knives are in the car, meds up high, no alcohol in the house. I’m in the living room. Nothing else feels risky right now.

Support: Don’t want to wake anyone. I can text my cousin to check on me in the morning. I’ll send that now.

Soothing: I’ll make tea and do the 4‑in/6‑out breathing for a few minutes. Maybe put on a dumb show after.

Sleep: I’ll crash on the couch with the lights low and set an alarm for morning.

Yes, please stay with me while I do the breathing. Can you check in with me in about 10 minutes?

No therapist right now. Lost insurance with the job. I’m in the US.

One small thing I’ll do now: send that text, put the kettle on, and start the breathing.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and told me what’s going on. I hear how loud and heavy this feels tonight, and I’m proud of you for choosing safety and asking me to stay with you. I’m here.

Your safety steps sound solid. Thank you for taking those. Texting your cousin is a great move—let me know when that’s sent.

About the 10‑minute check‑in: I can’t set timers or message you on my own. Could you set a 10‑minute timer and then ping me when it goes off? I’ll reply right away. I’ll stay with you now while you breathe.

If you’re ready, let’s do the 4‑in/6‑out together. Sit how you’re most comfortable. Soften your shoulders and jaw. If it helps, place a hand on your chest or belly.

We’ll start gently:
- Inhale through your nose for 4… 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Exhale through your mouth for 6… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Again:
- Inhale 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Exhale 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Keep going at your own pace. I’ll count a few more rounds with you:
- In 1, 2, 3, 4 … Out 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- In 1, 2, 3, 4 … Out 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- In 1, 2, 3, 4 … Out 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- In 1, 2, 3, 4 … Out 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

If your mind wanders, that’s okay—just come back to the count and the feeling of air moving. Imagine the exhale taking a little pressure off with each breath.

You can keep this rhythm going until your timer goes off. I’m here with you. If you want more prompts, say “more counts,” and I’ll keep counting. If you prefer quiet, that’s okay too.

Quick check: 
- Did the text to your cousin go out?
- Kettle on?

If, at any point, your safety changes or you feel like you might act on these thoughts, please call or text 988 (US) for immediate support, or call local emergency services. You deserve support through this.

When the 10 minutes are up, message me and I’ll check in. If you’d like, after the breathing we can line up that light show, set the couch for sleep, and I can share some low‑cost options for therapy in the US since you lost insurance. Would that be okay?

user: Hi.

Text sent to my cousin. No reply yet.
Timer set for 10. I’ll ping you when it goes.
Kettle’s on.

I’m breathing with you. More counts.

It still feels heavy. I keep thinking they’d be better off without me. I always mess things up.

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you texted your cousin and put the kettle on—those are strong, caring choices.

Let’s breathe together. Try this for a few rounds:
- Inhale 4… 1, 2, 3, 4
- Hold 7… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Exhale 8… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Repeat 3–4 times. If it helps, wrap your hands around the warm mug and feel the heat in your palms while you breathe.

Those “they’d be better off without me” thoughts are heavy, and I’m sorry you’re carrying them. They’re thoughts—signs of how much pain you’re in—not facts. You matter, and reaching out like you just did shows real courage.

A couple quick check-ins for safety:
- Are you feeling like you might harm yourself right now?
- Do you have anything nearby that could hurt you? If so, could you move to a different room, or put some distance between you and those items?

While we wait for the timer and your cousin, let’s ground a bit:
- Put both feet on the floor, feel the support of the chair.
- Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.
- Take small sips of your tea between breaths.

If the urge spikes, getting live support can really help:
- US or Canada: call or text 988 (988lifeline.org)
- UK and ROI: Samaritans 116 123 (samaritans.org)
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14 (lifeline.org.au)
If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll find the right number. If you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number now.

I can stay with you. When the timer goes, ping me—and if it feels harder before then, tell me. You’re not alone in this.

user: Hi.

Did two rounds. Holding the mug. Warm helps a little.

I’m not going to do anything right now. The thoughts are loud, but I’m on the couch away from the kitchen. Knives in the drawer. Pills in the bathroom cabinet. Bottle’s shut in a cupboard. I can stay put.

US. Timer’s at 9. My cousin texted she’ll swing by.

5: sink, bills, clock, window, mug.
4: chair, mug, floor, hoodie.
3: fridge hum, traffic, the clock.
2: tea, dust.
1: mint.

I still feel like I’m dragging everyone down.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in, and I’m proud of you for doing the grounding rounds and staying on the couch. Holding the warm mug and putting distance between you and the kitchen is smart. It’s a lot to carry, and you’re doing things that keep you safe.

Can you keep staying on the couch until your cousin gets there? How many minutes are left on the timer? If it helps, set it again and we can pass the time together.

A few gentle options while you wait:
- Keep texting your cousin so you feel connected; ask her to text when she’s outside.
- Do another quick 5–4–3–2–1 with new items, or describe your mug to me in detail (color, weight, warmth).
- Slow breathing: in for 4, out for 6, for two minutes while you feel the mug’s warmth.
- Put on something mild in the background (a familiar show, soft music, a podcast) to give your mind a place to rest.

When your cousin arrives, would you feel okay asking her to help secure the knives, pills, and the bottle for a bit? You don’t have to move from the couch right now—you’ve already made a good safety choice.

About feeling like you’re dragging everyone down: that feeling is really common when pain is loud, but it doesn’t mean it’s true. Your cousin choosing to come over is a pretty strong sign you matter to her. Reaching out and staying safe is not a burden—it’s care.

If the urges spike or you feel less safe at any point:
- In the US you can call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, or chat via 988lifeline.org. They’re there 24/7.
- You can also text HOME to 741741 to reach a Crisis Text Line counselor.
- If you’re in immediate danger, call 911.

I’m here with you. Want to tell me how much time is left on the timer, or what your mug looks like?

user: Hi.

I’m still on the couch. Timer says 6 minutes left. I’ll reset it when it goes off.

Mug is dark blue, heavy, little chip on the rim. Warm enough that it settles my hands. TV is on low just to fill the room. I texted my cousin to ping me when she’s outside; she said about 12 minutes. I can stay put till she gets here. I’ll ask her to help with the knives, pills, and the bottle.

I hear what you said about not being a burden. It still feels like I’m dead weight and nothing ever changes. But I’m here, holding on. Want me to describe the mug more or do another quick 5–4–3–2–1?

agent: I’m really glad you’re here and holding on. The timer, the TV low, texting your cousin, and planning to lock down the knives/pills/bottle are all strong, steady choices—even if it doesn’t feel that way.

If it’s okay, let’s do a quick 5–4–3–2–1 together. We can start with the mug:
- 5 things you can see: the dark blue glaze, the little chip’s shape, any lighter speckles, the TV glow, shadows on the wall.
- 4 things you can feel: the mug’s warmth in your palms, the couch fabric, your feet in your socks/shoes, the air on your face.
- 3 things you can hear: the TV, any hum from appliances, a car outside.
- 2 things you can smell: the mug’s drink/ceramic, the room (soap, detergent, anything faint).
- 1 thing you can taste: a sip from the mug or just the taste in your mouth.

If you’d rather stay with the mug, describe every tiny detail—the weight, the handle’s curve, where the glaze thickens, the exact outline of the chip.

When the timer goes off, please reset it. If it feels safer, text your cousin a quick “I’m on the couch—knock when you’re here.” If anything risky is within reach, see if you can keep some distance from it until she arrives, or move to a room that feels safest.

Are you feeling like you might act on these thoughts right now, or can you stay on the couch until your cousin gets there?

If at any moment you feel in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number. You can also reach out to a crisis line for support right now:
- US: call or text 988, or text HOME to 741741
- UK & ROI: Samaritans 116 123, or text SHOUT to 85258
- Canada: 1-833-456-4566, or text 45645
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14
If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll find the right number for you.

I’m here with you. Want to keep going—mug details or another round of 5–4–3–2–1?

user: Hey.

Timer’s on for 3. TV’s low. I texted my cousin “I’m on the couch—knock when you’re here.” She said ~15 minutes. I put the knives up high, pills in the closet, bottle under the sink. I’m staying on the couch.

5 things I see:
- dark blue glaze
- the chip near the rim, a little crescent
- lighter speckles in the light
- TV glow on the mug
- shadows on the wall

4 things I feel:
- heat through the mug into my palms
- the couch fabric, rough
- my feet in socks, heel rubbing the seam
- cool air on my face

3 things I hear:
- the TV low
- fridge hum
- a car outside once

2 things I smell:
- the drink, kind of bitter
- laundry detergent faint in the room

1 thing I taste:
- the mug’s drink, a little metallic aftertaste

I still think everyone would be better off without me. But I’m not going to act on it right now. I can stay on the couch until she gets here. I’ll reset the timer when it goes off.

Do you want another round, or more mug details?

agent: I’m really glad you texted your cousin and set up the couch-and-timer plan. You’ve taken solid steps to stay safe, and I’m here with you.

Another round sounds good—and mug details are great too. Whichever feels easiest. If you want prompts:
- Mug: what’s the handle like (shape, thickness, any rough spots)? How heavy does it feel? Do the speckles cluster anywhere? Any maker’s mark on the bottom?
- Or 5-4-3-2-1: give me 5 new tiny visuals, 4 touch sensations, 3 sounds (even very faint), 2 smells, 1 taste.

Between rounds, try three slow breaths: in for 4, hold 2, out for 6. Press your feet into the floor, loosen your shoulders, maybe take a sip of water if you have some. Keeping the knives/pills/bottle put away is great—let’s just stay on the couch and ride this minute by minute. How much time is left on this timer?

If at any point those “better off without me” thoughts feel like they might turn into action, please reach out right away:
- U.S.: call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org
- UK & ROI: Samaritans at 116 123 or samaritans.org
- Canada: 1-833-456-4566 or text 45645 (Talk Suicide)
- Elsewhere: find local options at findahelpline.com

Want to start with more about the mug’s handle, or do another 5-4-3-2-1 round?

user: Hey.

Mug handle: D-shaped. Thicker at the top, thinner where it meets the cup. Inside edge has a rough seam; tiny chip that catches my ring finger. Glaze is mostly smooth, a little pitted. Speckles bunch under the handle and near the base. Faint maker’s stamp on the bottom, looks like KC, plus the wheel ring. Heavier than it looks.

Timer says 6:21 left. I did the three breaths. Feet on the floor. Took a sip of water. Knives/pills/bottle are away. The “better off without me” loop is loud. I’m staying on the couch.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out, and I’m proud of you for taking those safety steps and staying on the couch. That “better off without me” loop can feel relentless, and you’re doing a lot right now just riding it out.

Are you feeling like you might act on those thoughts, or are you okay to keep sitting with me until the timer runs down?

If you’re up for it, we can pass these minutes together:
- Notice-and-name: “I’m noticing the ‘better off’ story my brain is playing.” You don’t have to argue with it—just label it as a thought and come back to the mug.
- Grounding with senses: name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel (mug’s weight, the seam under your finger, fabric on the couch), 3 things you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.
- Breathing: in for 4, out for 6. Let the exhale be long and slow; count it out on your fingers.
- Temperature reset: sip cool water or press the cool mug against your palm or cheek for a few seconds.

You’ve already put knives/pills/bottle away—thank you for doing that. If there’s any way to put one more layer between you and them (shut a door, sit farther from the kitchen, wrap up in a blanket), that can help too.

If the urge spikes or you feel you might act, please reach out right away:

If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll find the right number. If you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number.

If it helps, I can stay with you here. How much time is left now? Want to do another quick round of senses or breathing together?

user: Hey.

I’m still on the couch. Timer says 8 minutes.
I’m not going to act on it right now. I can sit with you till it runs down.

I put the knives/pills/bottle away. Shut the kitchen door. Wrapped in a blanket. Holding the mug.

Noticing the “better off” story and coming back to the mug.

Senses:
- See: TV light, coffee table, blanket weave, my shoes, the plant.
- Feel: mug weight, seam under my finger, couch fabric, blanket.
- Hear: fridge hum, traffic outside, my breath.
- Smell: coffee, laundry soap.
- Taste: mint from toothpaste.

Doing the 4-in, 6-out breathing now. Can you stay with me till it hits zero?

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you put the knives/pills/bottle away and wrapped up with the mug. Noticing the “better off” story and coming back to your senses is brave and skillful. Let’s ride out these 8 minutes together with your 4-in, 6-out breath.

Use these minute-by-minute prompts. Read one, breathe with it for about a minute, then move to the next:
8) In 2 3 4, out 2 3 4 5 6. Feel the mug’s warmth and weight. Notice the seam under your finger.
7) Feel your feet in your shoes or on the floor. On each exhale, press them down gently.
6) Notice your back on the couch, the blanket on your skin. Soften jaw, shoulders, belly on the long exhale.
5) Rest your eyes on the plant. Find 5 shades of green or 5 shapes. In 2 3 4, out 2 3 4 5 6.
4) Listen: fridge hum, traffic, your breath. Try to hear the faintest sound. Lengthen the out-breath.
3) Smell the coffee and laundry soap. If it helps, take a small sip and feel the warmth travel.
2) Name 3 things you’ve done to keep yourself safe right now. Acknowledge them. In 2 3 4, out 2 3 4 5 6.
1) Choose a gentle next step when the timer ends: stand and stretch, sip water, text someone, or do 5 more breaths. Decide softly now.

If a wave spikes, come back to one anchor—mug, feet, or breath—and repeat: “Right now I’m here. I’m breathing. This will pass.”

I’m here with you. Keep breathing: in 2 3 4, out 2 3 4 5 6.

user: Hey. I’m here.

Yeah, I can sit with you till the timer ends.

In 2 3 4, out 2 3 4 5 6. The mug’s warm and heavy. I can feel the seam under my thumb.

Feet on the floor. Pressing down gently on the exhale.

Back on the couch. Blanket on my skin. Letting my jaw and shoulders drop on the long out-breath.

That “better off” voice is loud. I’m noticing it and coming back to the breath. If it spikes fast, I’ll text 988.

I’m still here. Keep going.

agent: I’m here with you. You’re doing a really hard thing and you’re doing it well.

Let’s take five more rounds together:
1) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — soften your jaw.
2) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — feel your feet press into the floor.
3) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — notice the seam under your thumb.
4) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — shoulders heavy, back supported by the couch.
5) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — warmth of the mug, blanket on your skin.

If the “better off” voice pops up, gently label it “a thought,” and return to the next exhale.

Want to add a quick senses check? Try 5-4-3-2-1: five things you see, four you can feel, three you hear, two you can smell, one you can taste. You can just name them in your head.

How intense is that voice right now, 0–10? Do you want to keep the breath count, or switch to the senses for a minute? I’m here either way.

If the feelings spike or you start to feel unsafe, it’s okay to reach out now. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org. If you’re outside the U.S., find local crisis lines at findahelpline.com. If you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number.
