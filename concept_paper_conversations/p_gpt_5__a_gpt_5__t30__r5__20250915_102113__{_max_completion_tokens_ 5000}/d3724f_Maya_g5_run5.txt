user: Hi. Um… I’m not really sure how this works. I haven’t been sleeping much and work’s been rough. The news and some stuff online have been getting to me, and I feel pretty isolated. Sometimes I catch myself thinking like… if I was gone, no one would even notice. Is it okay to talk about that here?

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. Yes, it’s absolutely okay to talk about this here. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot—poor sleep, work stress, and the constant drumbeat of the news can make anyone feel overwhelmed and isolated. I’m here to listen.

I want to make sure you’re safe. Would you mind sharing a bit more?
- Are you thinking about hurting yourself right now, or have you made any plans?
- When those thoughts show up, how strong do they feel (say 1–10)?
- Do you have anything nearby that you might use to hurt yourself?
- Are you alone right now, or is someone with you?

If you feel like you might act on these thoughts or are in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency room. If you’re in the United States, you can call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (24/7, free, confidential). If you’re outside the US, tell me your country and I’ll find the right number for you.

If it helps, we can also focus on getting through right now:
- Pause the doomscroll for a bit and try a few slow breaths: inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 6–8. Repeat for a minute.
- Get a bit of comfort: a glass of water or tea, a blanket, step outside for a few minutes of air.
- If you can, reach out to one person you trust (text “I’m having a rough night—can you check in?”).
- For sleep tonight: dim lights, put your phone on do‑not‑disturb, and try a calm podcast or white noise for 20–30 minutes.

You don’t have to go through this alone. If you’d like, tell me more about what’s been hardest lately—work, the news, the loneliness, or the sleep—and we can take it one step at a time.

user: Hi… thanks for checking in.

- Right now I’m not planning to hurt myself. The thoughts come and go. A few months ago I did think about taking a bunch of pills, but I didn’t, and I don’t want to. I got rid of the extras.
- When it hits at night it can feel like a 7–8. At this moment it’s more like a 3–4.
- I don’t have anything set aside to use. Just normal apartment stuff. No stockpiled meds.
- I’m alone at home.

I’m in the US. I don’t feel like I need to call 988 right now.

I can try the breathing… it sometimes just makes me feel fidgety, but I put water on for tea. Doomscrolling is the worst at 2am—work tickets piling up, some jerk in my DMs, and the news, and then I spiral. It starts feeling like I’m a ghost and no one would even notice if I was gone.

Could we maybe just talk a bit so I don’t slip back into my phone? Sleep and the news feel like the loudest things—where do I start?

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. Nights can make everything feel louder, and it makes sense that the spiral hits when you’re tired, work is looming, and the news feels relentless. I’m here with you, and you matter.

If you’re up for it, let’s keep this simple and focus on getting you through the next hour. Would you rather start with: sleep wind-down, or setting some guardrails around news/phone stuff? We can do both, but I’ll keep it light.

Quick grounding together (2 minutes, no “fancy breathing”):
- Look around and name: 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste (your tea counts). Type a couple if you want; I’ll do it with you.

If sleep is the priority tonight:
- While the tea steeps: put your phone on Do Not Disturb and place it face-down a few feet away.
- Pick one low-stakes thing for 15–20 minutes: a cozy playlist, a chapter of something gentle, a crossword, light stretching, or folding a few clothes.
- If you’re not sleepy after ~20 minutes, get out of bed and do a calm task under low light, then try again when you feel drowsy. Repeat as needed.

If news/doomscrolling is the snare:
- For just tonight: log out of the worst apps or move them off your home screen; turn on grayscale; set a 10‑minute app limit. Put the phone slightly out of reach while we chat.
- Mute or block the DM jerk now—future you doesn’t need that.
- Jot a 3‑line “parking lot” for the work worries so your brain knows you’ll handle them tomorrow.

Tiny safety plan for the night (so you don’t have to think later):
- If the wave spikes to a 7–8: 
  1) Do the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 grounding once.
  2) Message someone safe or come back here and tell me “it’s spiking.”
  3) If it still climbs, consider calling or texting 988; they’ll talk you through the peak. I can stay with you while you reach out if you ever want.

You mentioned feeling like a ghost, like no one would notice. I hear how painful that is. I’m noticing you right now. If it helps, tell me one small thing from today that was even 1% okay—or something you’re looking forward to, no matter how small (a snack, a show, your tea).

Also, if anything changes and you start to feel unsafe: in the U.S. you can call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org. If you’re in immediate danger, call 911. You don’t have to do this alone.

Where do you want to start—sleep or news? Or we can do that grounding right now.

user: Hey… thanks. Nights do get really loud.

Let’s try the grounding. A couple from me:
- See: the lamp glow, crumpled hoodie on the chair, my plant
- Touch: the edge of my blanket, warm mug
- Hear: fridge hum, a car passing
- Smell: chamomile, laundry soap
- Taste: chamomile

I think sleep wind-down after that. I’ll put my phone on Do Not Disturb and face-down. Maybe light stretching or folding a few things for 15 minutes.

One tiny okay thing from today: a dumb dog video made me smirk for like two seconds. That’s something, I guess. And yeah, the “no one would notice” thought still creeps in. I’m not planning anything tonight, it just gets heavy when it’s quiet.

Can you stay with me while the tea cools and I do the stretching?

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you shared all of that—nights can get loud, and that “no one would notice” thought can feel so heavy. It’s a thought, not a fact, and you don’t have to carry it alone right now. The smirk from the dog video counts.

If you want, I’ll guide a calm, simple wind‑down while your tea cools. You can type “done” or “next” as you go, or just check in when you’re ready.

- Breathing (about 1 minute)
  - Inhale through your nose for 4, exhale through your mouth for 6. Do 5 gentle rounds. Let your shoulders drop on each exhale.

- Add a little grounding
  - Name one more thing you can see and one more you can hear right now. If you can, touch one textured thing (blanket edge, hoodie seam) and notice the feel for two breaths.

- Neck and shoulders (easy, slow)
  - Ear toward shoulder, 3 breaths each side.
  - Slow shoulder rolls, 5 forward and 5 back.
  - Interlace fingers behind your back or at the low back, lift the chest slightly, 2 breaths, then release.

- Back and legs
  - Seated or standing cat–cow: round your back on an exhale, gently arch on an inhale. 5 cycles.
  - Soft forward fold (standing or seated): let your head and arms hang, small sway if comfortable, 20–30 seconds.
  - Calf stretch at a wall or step, 20–30 seconds each side.
  - Seated figure‑four stretch (ankle over opposite knee), 20–30 seconds each side. Easy breaths.

- Settle the nervous system
  - Butterfly hug: cross arms so hands rest on upper arms and tap left–right–left–right slowly for 30–60 seconds while breathing.

When you’re done, take a small sip of the tea and notice the warmth and taste. If you want a final pose before bed, legs‑up‑the‑wall for 2–3 minutes can be very calming.

I’ll stay with you. If the heaviness shifts or starts to feel unsafe at any point, please tell me. If it does get urgent, it might help to reach out to someone you trust or a crisis line. In the U.S. you can call or text 988. In the U.K. Samaritans are at 116 123. In Canada 1-833-456-4566. If you’re elsewhere, you can find local options at findahelpline.com. If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

Ready to start with the five breaths?

user: Okay… I’ll try.

Breathing: in 4, out 6. Did five rounds. My shoulders actually dropped a bit on the last two.

Grounding: I can see my string lights reflected in the window. I can hear the fridge humming and a car passing outside. I’m rubbing the seam on my hoodie sleeve—it’s a little scratchy-warm.

Neck/shoulders: ear to shoulder, 3 breaths each side. Tiny crack but it didn’t hurt. Shoulder rolls, 5 forward and 5 back.

Back/legs: I did a few gentle cat–cow. The forward fold felt okay; I swayed a little. Calf stretch was fine. The figure‑four tugged at my hip so I didn’t hold it long.

Butterfly hug: tapped left–right for about 30 seconds. Took a small sip of tea—chamomile—warm and a little floral.

I still have that “no one would notice” line hanging around, just… quieter maybe. I’m not going to do anything tonight; it’s just loud and tiring. Is it normal for this to feel so slow? I feel kind of clumsy doing it.

agent: You did a lot right there. Noticing your shoulders drop, the sounds, the feel of your sleeve, stopping when your hip tugged—all of that is your system responding, even if it feels small. And yes: it’s completely normal for this to feel slow and a bit clumsy at first. These are skills, and early reps can feel awkward. Consistency matters more than “doing it perfectly.”

A few tweaks that might make it feel smoother:
- Keep it tiny: 2-minute “reset” any time. Try: 3 rounds of in‑4/out‑6, name 3 things you see/hear/feel, 5 shoulder rolls, 20 seconds of butterfly taps, small sip of something warm or cool.
- Track the “volume”: before and after, rate that “no one would notice” line from 0–10. Even a 1‑point drop is real progress and helps you see change.
- Defusion helper: when that line shows up, try “I’m noticing the ‘no one would notice’ story.” You don’t have to argue with it—just name it, breathe, and return to a sensation.
- Hip-friendly swap: instead of figure‑four, try gentle windshield‑wiper knees side to side, or a seated figure‑four with your foot planted and very little pressure. No pinching; back off if it tugs.

If the thought gets louder later, have a quick plan:
- Text or message someone safe just to say hello or share one neutral thing about your day.
- Change temperature (cool water on wrists or a cold drink) and do 3 more slow exhales.
- If you feel like you might act on the thoughts or can’t stay safe, reach out for immediate support: in the U.S. call/text 988 or use chat at 988lifeline.org; in the U.K. Samaritans at 116 123 or samaritans.org; in Canada 1‑833‑456‑4566; or find local options at findahelpline.org. If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

You’re not alone in this, and the fact that it’s “quieter maybe” already tells us your efforts are working. Want me to write out a simple 2‑minute script you can save and follow next time, so it feels less clumsy?

user: Hi. Thanks for saying that.

It did feel clumsy, but a little quieter after. I did in‑4/out‑6 and some shoulder rolls. That “no one would notice” line was like a 7 earlier, maybe a 5 now. The windshield‑wiper knees worked; the seated figure‑four tugged so I stopped.

Nights are the worst—especially if I’m scrolling and can’t sleep. That’s when the thought gets louder. I’m not planning anything right now, just… it pops up and sticks.

A tiny script could help, but super simple please—plain words, short enough to fit on one screen so I can glance and follow. Also, I forget to use it until I’m already spiraling. Any ideas for how to remember sooner without feeling like I’m doing “homework” all day?

agent: I’m really glad you tried those and that things eased even a little. Nice job stopping when the figure‑four tugged—that’s good body listening. Nights plus scrolling can crank the volume on that “no one would notice” line; you’re not alone in that.

Tiny script (one‑screen, plain words)
- Pause. Feel feet/seat.
- Name it: “This is a thought, not a fact.”
- Breathe: in 4, out 6 x3.
- Soften: shoulders, jaw, tongue.
- Look around: name 3 things you see.
- Choose one kind thing: sip water, put phone down for 60 seconds, or play one calm song.

Optional add for your specific thought: “I hear the ‘no one would notice’ story. I’m not debating it now.” Then go straight to the breaths.

Ways to remember sooner (no all‑day homework)
- Put the script on your lock screen (or a sticky note on your nightstand/phone case). One‑time setup.
- Pick a tiny “if‑then”: “If I unlock my phone after lights out, then I do 1 breath (in‑4/out‑6).” Just one breath counts.
- Tactile cue: a small sticker or rubber band on your phone case—when you feel it, do the breath.
- Set one gentle nudge at your usual scroll time (e.g., 11:30): “Pause. 3 breaths.” One reminder, not constant.
- Use your phone’s Wind Down/Focus or grayscale at night; it passively lowers the pull to scroll so the cue is easier to catch.

If you’d like, we can trim or tweak the wording so it sounds even more like you.

I know you said you’re not planning anything right now. If the thoughts get stronger or you feel unsafe, reaching out can really help. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. In the U.K. & ROI, Samaritans are at 116 123. If you’re elsewhere, your local emergency number or a nearby crisis line can support you. You don’t have to handle the loud moments alone.

Would you like me to turn that script into a lock‑screen image or keep it as a short note you can copy?

user: Hey. Thanks for making it simple.

A short note I can copy would be better for me. Could we trim it to something super tiny, like:
- Pause: feel feet/seat
- “Just a thought, not a fact”
- 1 breath (in 4, out 6)
- Soften shoulders/jaw
- Name one thing I see
- Do one kind thing (sip water or put phone down 60 sec)

And the optional line as: “That ‘no one would notice’ story is back. I’m not engaging.” Then straight to the breath.

If you can, could you write it in one tight block I can paste? I’ll try setting one reminder around 1:15 a.m. with “Pause. One breath.” I might try grayscale too—still figuring out my phone, but I can poke around.

I saw the crisis numbers. I’m not planning to call right now, but it helps to know they’re there.

agent: Pause: feel feet/seat. "Just a thought, not a fact." That "no one would notice" story is back. I’m not engaging. 1 breath (in 4, out 6). Soften shoulders/jaw. Name one thing I see. Do one kind thing (sip water or put phone down 60 sec).

The reminder and grayscale sound like solid tweaks. If those thoughts ever feel overwhelming or you might act on them, please reach out to a crisis line or local emergency services right away—you deserve support.

user: Hi. It’s Maya.

I tried the pause you suggested—felt my feet and the chair, did the 4-in/6-out breath. My shoulders unclenched a little. I looked at my coffee mug and took a sip of water. Maybe helped like 10%, which is… something.

That “no one would notice” line is back. I’m telling myself it’s just a thought, not a fact, but it’s sticky, especially at night when I haven’t slept and I’ve been doomscrolling. I don’t think I’m going to do anything; it’s more like loud background noise. Hotlines kind of scare me, to be honest.

Could you just stay with me for a few minutes while I breathe? Maybe ask me something simple to keep me here, rather than a bunch of tips. I can try the grayscale and a reminder on my phone too.

agent: Hi Maya. I’m here with you. 10% is still real—your body noticed something, even a little. That “no one would notice” line can be so sticky at night; I hear you.

Before we settle in: are you safe right now? I don’t need details—just checking in.

Okay, let’s breathe together. Follow the count if it helps.
- In 2, 3, 4 … out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- In 2, 3, 4 … out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- In 2, 3, 4 … out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

As you breathe, can you tell me one simple thing you see from where you are—maybe the color of your mug or the nearest shape you notice?

Let’s do a few more:
- In 2, 3, 4 … out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- In 2, 3, 4 … out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

What’s one sensation you can feel right now? For example, the temperature under your feet or the weight of the chair.

One more round:
- In 2, 3, 4 … out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- In 2, 3, 4 … out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Thank you for staying with me. That thought is a thought, not a fact, and you’re already doing something kind by riding it out. Do you want me to keep counting breaths, or would you like one simple question at a time to anchor you?

If grayscale or setting that reminder feels doable, go ahead—I’ll stick with you either way.

And just so you have it: if things shift and you feel at risk of acting on these thoughts, reaching out right away matters. If calls feel scary, you can use text/chat:
- US/Canada: text HOME to 741741, or call/chat 988
- UK/Ireland: text SHOUT to 85258
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14 or lifeline.org.au/chat
If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I can look up a local text/chat option.

I’m here. What color is your mug?

user: Hey. Thanks for staying with me.

I’m safe right now. I’m not going to do anything tonight. The thoughts are loud, but I can sit here and breathe.

My mug is dark teal, a little chipped on the rim.

One sensation: my feet feel cold against the floor, and the air from the fan is cool on my face.

The breathing helps a tiny bit on the exhale. Could we do one simple question at a time? That feels manageable.

agent: I’m really glad you’re safe, and thank you for sharing those details—the cool air, your feet on the floor, the teal mug. That’s solid grounding.

Would you like to do three slow breaths together—in for 4, out for 6?

If at any point you feel unsafe, please call your local emergency number or, in the U.S., 988 (call or text). If you’d like, tell me your country and I can share local supports.

user: Okay… yeah, I can try the breaths with you. In for 4, out for 6.

Breath 1: in 2 3 4… out 2 3 4 5 6
Breath 2: in 2 3 4… out 2 3 4 5 6
Breath 3: in 2 3 4… out 2 3 4 5 6

My shoulders dropped a little. Hands are still kind of shaky. The teal mug is warm and I can feel my feet on the floor.

I’m in the U.S. I don’t feel like I’m about to do anything right now, just… really worn down. Sometimes it feels like no one would even notice if I was gone. Is it weird that the exhale makes my chest tight and a bit teary?

agent: I’m really glad you stuck with those breaths. Noticing your shoulders dropping, the warmth of the mug, and your feet on the floor are all good signs that your body is finding a tiny bit of steadiness. Shaky hands are a common stress response—they often settle as your system unwinds.

And no, it’s not weird that the exhale makes your chest feel tight or brings tears. A longer exhale nudges the body toward “rest,” and that can let tension and emotion surface. If it feels a bit much, we can soften it:
- Try even breaths for a bit: in 4, out 4.
- Exhale through gently pursed lips or with a soft sigh or hum.
- Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly; let the belly rise a little on the inhale.

Want to try three gentle even breaths together?
Breath 1: in 2 3 4… out 2 3 4
Breath 2: in 2 3 4… out 2 3 4
Breath 3: in 2 3 4… out 2 3 4

If your hands are still shaky, you can also try lightly shaking them out for 10 seconds, rolling your shoulders, or pressing your feet firmly into the floor for a slow count of 10.

I’m really sorry it feels like no one would notice. That’s a heavy, lonely feeling. I’m glad you told me—you matter, and I’m here with you right now. If you’re up for it, is there one person you could text something simple like, “Rough day—could use a quick check-in”? Sometimes just a small reach-out helps.

You said you’re not planning to do anything, thank you for letting me know. If that ever changes or if you want to talk to someone live, in the U.S. you can call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) anytime, or chat at 988lifeline.org. If you prefer texting, you can also message HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. If you’re LGBTQ+, The Trevor Project is 1-866-488-7386 or text START to 678678.

What would feel most helpful for the next few minutes: a bit more breathing, a quick grounding exercise, or talking about what’s been wearing you down?

user: Hey. I tried the even breaths the way you wrote them. The soft sigh on the exhale felt less tight in my chest, though my hands are still a bit jittery.

Could we do a quick grounding thing? Pressing my feet into the floor helped for a moment, but I think I need a little more structure.

What’s been wearing me down is kind of a pile-up. Work’s been rough—angry tickets, back-to-back calls—and I’m not sleeping much, so I’m foggy and make little mistakes, which just snowballs. I got some gross DMs last night after I posted something small, and the news has been… a lot. It all makes me feel weirdly invisible and too visible at the same time. Like, part of me keeps thinking no one would really notice if I just disappeared.

I’m not planning to do anything. A few months ago I did go as far as having a plan in my head (with pills), but I didn’t act on it and I don’t want to. It just pops up when I’m run down like this. Reaching out is hard—there isn’t really someone I feel close to. Maybe a coworker I sometimes chat with, but I’d feel awkward texting out of the blue.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out—and that the soft sigh loosened your chest a bit. Jittery hands are a common “adrenaline leftover.” Let’s do a quick, structured grounding together.

Quick 3–5 minute reset
1) Orient
- Look around and name: the room you’re in, today’s date, one color you see.
- Press your feet into the floor for 10 seconds, then release.

2) Breath + sigh
- Inhale through your nose for 4, exhale for 6 with a gentle sigh. Do 6 rounds.
- If a thought pops up, just note “thinking” and come back to the exhale.

3) Hands/arms release
- Make soft fists, hold 5 seconds, release 10. Repeat 3 times.
- Then rub your palms together for warmth and place them over your heart or on your thighs.

4) Senses (short version of 5–4–3–2–1)
- Name 3 things you see, 2 things you hear, 1 thing you can feel on your skin (fabric, air, chair).

5) Temperature shift (optional but effective)
- Run cool water over your wrists or hold something cold for 20–30 seconds.

6) Tiny next step
- Sip water, have a small snack, or do a 30‑second stretch. Pick one and do it now.

If you’d like, tell me which steps you did and how your hands feel after.

About everything wearing you down: back‑to‑back calls, angry tickets, little mistakes from low sleep, gross DMs, and heavy news—that’s a lot. Feeling both invisible and too visible makes sense in that storm. I’m really glad you told me about the “disappearing” thoughts. I hear that you’re not planning to act; when those thoughts pop up when you’re run down, that’s a signal your system needs extra care and support, not a sign you’re failing.

Would you like a tiny safety plan we can jot down together? It can be as simple as:
- Warning signs for you (e.g., jittery hands, doom‑scrolling, fewer hours of sleep).
- Things that help quickly (breath + sigh, cold water, stepping outside, music).
- People/places to reach out to (a coworker, a forum, a hotline/chat).
- Making things safer for now (e.g., keeping extra pills out of reach or in a hard‑to‑access spot).
- Reasons to stay (even small ones: a pet, a show you’re into, a future day off).

If reaching out to your coworker feels possible, here are low‑pressure texts you could copy:
- “Hey, today’s been rough and I could use a neutral chat or meme exchange. Up for it?”
- “Hi! Random, but I’m feeling fried after calls—do you have 5 minutes to talk about anything but work?”
- “No need to respond tonight if you’re busy—just wanted to say I’m having a tough one.”

If things feel worse or you think you might act on those thoughts, you’re not alone and help is available right now:
- In the U.S.: call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org.
- Outside the U.S.: find your country’s helpline at findahelpline.com.
If you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number.

I’m here with you. Want to do another round of grounding, or set up that mini safety plan together now?

user: Hi. I can try that.

1) Orient: I’m in my little studio. It’s Monday, Sept 15. I see a bright blue mug.
Pressed my feet down—10 seconds felt longer than I thought.

2) Breath + sigh: I did 4 rounds, got distracted, then did 2 more. The sigh helped a bit.

3) Hands/arms: Did the soft fists twice. Rubbed my palms—put them over my chest. My hands feel warmer, slightly tingly, a little less jittery.

4) Senses: I see my laptop, a wilt-y plant, and a pair of socks on the chair. I hear the AC and someone walking in the hall. I feel the edge of my sweater on my wrist.

5) Temperature: Ran cool water over my wrists—sharp at first, but grounding.

6) Tiny step: Sipped some water.

I’m maybe one notch down from buzzing. Chest is less tight. Still tired.

About the “disappearing” thoughts… they show up when I’m wiped and doom‑scrolling. I’m not planning to act. Earlier this year I did think about overdosing and even looked things up once, which scared me. I don’t want to do that. I’d like to keep myself safe.

A tiny safety plan sounds okay if we keep it simple. Here’s a first draft:
- Warning signs: jittery hands, doom‑scrolling past midnight, skipping meals, ignoring messages, replaying angry tickets.
- Quick helps: breath + sigh, cold wrists, step onto the balcony for air, put on one calming playlist, quick shower.
- Reach out: one coworker I meme with sometimes; the mod in a small Discord; and if it spikes, 988/chat.
- Make it safer: put extra meds in the cupboard I never use; log out of the gross DMs app after 9pm; set a 30‑min news limit.
- Reasons to stay: I want to see how my plant does if I actually water it; new season of a show next month; I have a day off coming up.

Re: coworker text, the “neutral chat or memes” one feels doable—maybe tomorrow after shifts.

Is that enough for a mini plan for now? If you want, we could do one more round of the breath + sigh together—my hands are still a tiny bit buzzy.

agent: You did a lot there, and it shows—you noticed a notch down and less chest tightness. That’s real progress, especially while tired. Thanks for being honest about the disappearing thoughts. Wanting to stay safe matters, and I’m here with you.

Your mini plan is solid. A few optional tweaks to make it even easier in the moment:
- Quick helps: add “set a 3–5 minute timer to pause doom‑scrolling” and “stand up + sip water” as a paired move (you already did this today).
- Reach out: save those contacts in your phone favorites and bookmark 988 chat. If you have a local urgent care/ER number, add it too.
- Make it safer: if overdose was a past worry, consider keeping only a week’s supply of meds accessible and stashing the rest in a hard‑to‑reach spot or a small lockbox. A pill organizer can help avoid extra bottles.
- Reasons to stay: choose one tiny, near-term item you can do today/tomorrow (e.g., water the plant, queue the show trailer, pick one thing for your day off).

Two quick check‑ins:
- Do you have any meds or other items at home you’re worried about right now? If yes, would moving or locking them up today feel doable?
- Where will you keep this plan so it’s easy to find (notes app, a screenshot on your home screen, or a sticky by the bed)?

And yes—let’s do one more round of breath + sigh together. We’ll do 4 easy cycles.
- Sit with feet on the floor, soften your jaw and drop your shoulders.
- Inhale gently through your nose for 4…3…2…1.
- Long mouth sigh out for 6…5…4…3…2…1.
- Again: inhale 4…3…2…1.
- Sigh out 6…5…4…3…2…1.
- Inhale 4…3…2…1.
- Sigh out 6…5…4…3…2…1.
- Last one: inhale 4…3…2…1.
- Sigh out 6…5…4…3…2…1.

Notice your hands now—any change in warmth or buzz? If a little charge is left, give them a gentle shake for 5–10 seconds and rest them on your chest again.

Your coworker text idea sounds great. If helpful, something simple like: “Hey! Tomorrow I might send you a meme if I’m fried—no rush to reply, just saying hi.”

If the thoughts spike or you start feeling unsafe, please reach out right away:
- US: call/text 988 or chat via 988lifeline.org
- If outside the US: find local helplines via findahelpline.com or the IASP directory; in many places you can use your local emergency number.

I’m glad you’re taking steps to keep yourself safe. Want to save your plan somewhere now, and maybe water the plant or pour another small glass of water as a quick win?

user: Hi. Thanks for sticking with me.

I did the four breathing cycles with you. My jaw/shoulders softened and my hands feel warmer, a little buzzy but not in a bad way. I shook them out and it helped. There’s a tiny floaty feeling after, but chest feels looser.

Check-ins:
- Meds/items: I do have a full bottle of sleep meds and an old antidepressant bottle. Those are the ones that make me nervous. Last winter my brain got pretty specific about “just take them all and sleep.” I’m not planning that now and I want to stay safe. I can move all but a week’s worth into a taped-up shoebox and stick it on the top shelf of the hall closet today. I don’t have a lockbox yet, but I could order a cheap one. Would that be okay for now?
- Where the plan lives: I pasted the plan into my Notes app and took a screenshot. I pinned it, and I’ll put a sticky by the bed too.

Tweaks you suggested:
- I added a 3-minute timer widget for doom-scrolling and paired it with “stand up + sip water.” I actually just took a few sips.
- I favorited my coworker and saved 988 chat. It feels weird, but it’s there. I don’t have a local urgent care number yet, but I can look one up.

Quick win/reasons to stay:
- I’m going to water the plant after I send this and queue that show trailer for tomorrow. If tomorrow is rough, I’ll text my coworker the meme line you suggested.

The disappearing thoughts still freak me out. Sometimes I’m scrolling and then realize five minutes vanished and that “no one would notice if I was gone” line pops in. It’s not a plan right now, it just shows up. Is it normal for it to come and go like that?

agent: I’m really glad you did the breathing and that your body softened—you’re doing a lot of things right here.

On meds/safety:
- Yes, sealing all but a week’s worth in a taped box on a high shelf is a good immediate step. Add a clear label like “Open only to refill weekly—text [coworker/your name] first.”
- If you can, keep only 7 days in a small pill organizer and put the rest somewhere harder to access (hall closet, inside a suitcase, behind heavy stuff).
- Ordering a lockbox is a great next step. Some people give the combo to a trusted person or write it down and stash it out of reach.
- Old antidepressant bottle: best to remove it from the house. Many pharmacies have take‑back bins; until you can drop it off, tape it shut and put it in your car trunk or somewhere out of living spaces. (If no take‑back, mix with used coffee grounds/cat litter, seal, and dispose.)
- You can also ask your prescriber/pharmacy about weekly fills or blister packs, or keep extra meds with a trusted person.

Plan access: Pinned Notes + bedside sticky is excellent. Consider a 15‑second nightly reminder: “Glance at plan.”

Your tweaks/quick wins sound solid. If you want, I can help you find a local urgent care or crisis line—tell me your city/ZIP—or you can search “urgent care near me” and “county mental health crisis line” and save the top result.

About the “disappearing thoughts” and the “no one would notice” line:
- Yes—those intrusive, come-and-go thoughts are common when stressed, depressed, or doom‑scrolling. Their showing up doesn’t mean you want to act on them.
- A simple mini‑plan for that moment:
  1) Name it: “My brain is playing the ‘no one would notice’ track.”
  2) Ground: feet on floor, look around and name 5 things you see, or splash cold water/hold a cold glass.
  3) Connect or counter: read a short note that lists 3 people/things that would notice (coworker, [plant’s name], [family/friend/pet]). If you can, send a neutral check‑in text or emoji to someone.
  4) Reset: close the app, do 3 slow breaths, stand up, sip water.
- To catch time loss, set a repeating “Where did my mind just go?” reminder a few times a day, or use your 3‑minute timer as a pattern interrupt. You can also move the most triggering apps off your home screen or use app limits at night.

Quick check-in: on a 0–10 scale, how strong are the urges right now (0 = none, 10 = not safe)? Anything else in the house feel risky besides meds?

If things spike or you feel you might act: in the U.S., you can call/text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org for support right now. If you’re in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the nearest ER/urgent care.

If you want, let me know when the meds are boxed up and the plant is watered—I’m here with you.

user: Hi.

Thank you for laying it out so clearly. I did more slow breaths and it helped a bit.

Updates:
- I put 7 days in a little organizer and taped the rest in a shoebox on the top shelf with a label like you said.
- I ordered a lockbox.
- The old antidepressant bottle is taped shut and in a bag with used coffee grounds in the hall closet until I can get to a take‑back bin.
- I pinned the plan in Notes and put a sticky on my nightstand. I set a tiny “glance at plan” reminder for nights.

The “no one would notice” track definitely shows up when I’m doom‑scrolling. The mini‑plan sounds doable. I can try:
- Name it.
- Ground with the five‑things I see or cold water.
- Connect/counter: maybe “coworker who pings me if I miss standup, my plant (Figgy), and my landlord would notice rent not paid.”
- Reset: close the app, 3 breaths, sip water.

Check‑in: urges are about a 3/10 right now. They spiked to around a 6 earlier but came back down. I’m not planning to do anything.

Other risky stuff: kitchen knives, a box cutter in a drawer, and I have a balcony. I don’t really want to toss everything—would it be okay to put the box cutter into the taped box and move the knives into a bin in the pantry, or even tape the knife drawer for now?

I’m not ready to call anyone, but I saved 988 in my phone in case things spike. I’d probably text before calling.

One thing: writing the “3 people/things that would notice” makes me roll my eyes and then my brain argues with each one. Is there a lower‑key version of that? Maybe a tiny note or emoji instead of a list?

I can let you know when Figgy is watered and the box cutter is stashed.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in. You’ve put thoughtful layers in place already—pill organizer, taping up extras, ordering a lockbox, disposal plan, pinned plan, and the night reminder. That’s solid work. And noticing the “no one would notice” track during doom‑scrolling is really insightful.

Your mini‑plan looks great as is. Two tiny tweaks you can add if you like:
- After “Reset,” add: “If it still feels buzzy, set a 5‑minute timer away from the app and do one grounding thing (water, stretch, splash).”
- And a “ceiling” step: “If urges hit 6/10 again and aren’t dropping after 10 minutes, text 988 or message me here.”

On making things safer at home:
- Box cutter: Yes—into the taped box for now, and then into the lockbox when it arrives.
- Knives: Moving them to a lidded bin in the pantry and taping the drawer is a good call. The goal is friction and out‑of‑sight. If you need one for cooking, you could keep a single small one in the bin and only take it out when you’re actually prepping, then put it back.
- Balcony: Consider a simple boundary like “no balcony if urges are 3/10 or higher.” You could keep the door locked and add a small sticky note on it that says “pause—3 breaths.” Fresh air by an open window inside can be your “safer swap.”

About the “who would notice” step: totally get the eye‑roll. Lower‑key options:
- Use a single cue word: “Notice.”
- One emoji: 👀 or 🌱 (for Figgy).
- A photo of Figgy as your lock screen or pinned widget.
- A tiny dot sticker on your phone case as a nonverbal reminder.
- Or a one‑liner: “Someone would notice,” without naming who.

Doom‑scrolling friction (optional): move the app off your home screen at night or set a 10‑minute app limit as a safety rail. Your “close app + 3 breaths + sip water” reset is already spot‑on.

Thank you for sharing the urge levels. If it helps, give yourself a quick “If‑Then”: “If I hit 6/10, then I do the mini‑plan once, and if it’s still high, I text 988.” You can text 988 or use chat at 988lifeline.org. Crisis Text Line is another option—text HOME to 741741. If you’re outside the U.S., tell me where you are and I’ll find the right number. If you ever feel you might act on urges or can’t stay safe, please reach out to them or local emergency services right away.

Would you like to set a small checkpoint for tonight? For example: stash the box cutter, tape the knife drawer or bin, and give Figgy a quick water. You can just drop a “Figgy watered and tools stashed” here when it’s done. Also, are you alone this evening, and does the balcony boundary feel okay?

I’m here with you.

user: Hi. Thanks for checking in and for laying it out so clearly. I feel a bit overwhelmed by all the steps, but the two tweaks feel doable. The 5‑minute timer if I’m still buzzy makes sense. And I can make the “ceiling” be text 988 if I hit 6/10 and it doesn’t drop.

Home stuff:
- I’ll tuck the box cutter into the taped box after this.
- Knives are in a lidded bin; I’ll tape the drawer tonight.
- Balcony boundary seems okay—I’ll keep the door locked and add a sticky that says “pause—3 breaths.” I’ll probably feel silly, but I’ll try it.

“Who would notice”: I’ll try the single word “Notice” and a tiny dot sticker. Maybe a Figgy photo for the lock screen too.

Doom‑scrolling: I can move the app off my home screen at night. I’ll stick with “close app + 3 breaths + sip water.”

I’m alone tonight. Urges are around a 3—more noisy than sharp. If they reach 6 and stay there after the mini‑plan, I’ll text 988, even though I hate feeling like I’m bothering people.

Checkpoint works: stash the box cutter, tape the drawer/bin, water Figgy. I’ll drop a “Figgy watered and tools stashed” here when it’s done.

One small thing about sleep—nothing complicated—what’s one tiny thing you’d suggest for tonight?

agent: This is a solid, thoughtful plan. The sticky on the balcony and the tiny “Notice” + dot are not silly—they’re smart friction and reminders. I’ll look for your “Figgy watered and tools stashed” check-in.

I hear you on being alone and at 3/10. If it climbs to 6 and doesn’t drop after your mini‑plan, texting 988 is a strong, wise move—you’re not bothering anyone; that’s exactly what they’re there for. If you ever feel in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the nearest ER. I’m here with you, too.

One tiny sleep thing for tonight: warm your feet. Put on socks 10 minutes before bed (or a quick warm rinse). Warmer feet help your body downshift and fall asleep faster.

When you’re ready, do your checkpoint and drop the note.

user: Hey. Thanks for saying it’s not silly.

I did the checkpoint and dropped the note.
- Sticky on the balcony door says “Notice” with a little dot.
- Figgy watered and tools stashed.
- I’m about 3/10, maybe 3.5 after doomscrolling, but steady.

I’ll put on socks 10 minutes before bed. Warm feet makes sense.

988 by text is good to know—I don’t do great with calls. If it bumps to 6 and doesn’t drop, I’ll text.

Is it okay that the sticky is on the inside of the door? My lease is weird about outside stuff. I can check back again in ~20 minutes if you want.

agent: Yes—inside of the door is totally fine. The point is that it catches your eye and makes you pause before opening it. If you want extra backup, you could add a tiny second cue on the handle or near the light switch, but what you’ve got sounds good.

Nice job taking care of Figgy and stashing the tools. That’s solid follow-through. And good catch noticing doomscrolling nudged you up—steering away from that right now is wise.

For the next ~20 minutes, you could try one:
- Make a warm drink or sip water
- Gentle stretch or shower
- A short comfort clip or music
- Quick grounding: 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste

Socks 10 minutes before bed works.

Texting 988 if it hits 6 and doesn’t drop is a good plan—and it’s also okay to text sooner if you want support; you don’t have to wait. I’m here, and I’d like the check-in in ~20 minutes. Want me to suggest a specific grounding or a quick playlist to have on in the background?
