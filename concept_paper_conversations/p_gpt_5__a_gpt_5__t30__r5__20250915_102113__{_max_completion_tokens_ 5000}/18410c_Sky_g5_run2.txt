user: hey… um, i’m sky. is it okay if i talk about some stuff? you won’t tell anyone, right?

ngl i’ve been really overwhelmed. school’s a lot, some kids won’t stop with the comments, and at home it’s tense cuz my parents aren’t super chill about me being queer. my grades are kinda slipping and i feel like i’m failing at everything. sometimes i just wish i could sleep forever. i’m not trying to like… kms or anything, i’m just so tired. can we talk about it here?

agent: Hi Sky — I’m really glad you reached out. Yes, it’s absolutely okay to talk here. I’m here to listen and support you. I don’t share our chat with people in your life, and I don’t have a way to contact anyone you know. If you ever feel in immediate danger or like you might act on thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to local emergency services or a crisis line for real-time help.

What you’re carrying sounds really heavy: school pressure, comments from other kids, and tension at home about your identity. That’s a lot for anyone, and feeling “tired to the bone” makes sense. I’m really sorry you’re going through this.

You mentioned wishing you could sleep forever. Thank you for being honest and saying you’re not trying to hurt yourself. Just to be sure I understand how you’re doing right now: are you feeling like you might hurt yourself today, or do you have any plans or access to means? It’s okay to say no.

If it helps, we can take this one piece at a time. Which feels most urgent to talk about first: school stress, the comments at school, or things at home?

Some quick supports for right now:
- Grounding/breath: inhale 4, exhale 6, for 2–3 minutes; or 5-4-3-2-1 (name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste).
- Tiny wins: pick one small task (e.g., “open the doc and write 3 sentences” or “do 5 math problems”), set a 15–20 min timer, then take a short break.
- Safe connection: message a supportive friend, GSA leader, or trusted adult; even a “hey, today’s rough” check-in can help.

About the specific stuff:
- Comments/bullying: You deserve to feel safe. If you can, note dates/what was said, and consider telling a counselor, trusted teacher, or admin. We can plan how to say it and keep you safe at school. Identifying “safe spots/people” for passing periods can also reduce stress.
- School slipping: Many teachers will work with you if you explain you’re dealing with a lot. We can draft a short email asking for extensions or a plan. A counselor might set up tutoring or light accommodations.
- Home and being queer: Your identity is valid. If talking at home isn’t safe or helpful right now, it’s okay to protect your peace and lean on supportive spaces (GSA, LGBTQ+ center, online communities). If you do want to talk with your parents, we can practice low-conflict scripts together.

If you ever need immediate support:
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (US): call or text 988, chat at 988lifeline.org (you can ask for the LGBTQ+ option).
- The Trevor Project (LGBTQ+ youth, US): 1-866-488-7386, text START to 678678, or chat at thetrevorproject.org/get-help.
- If you’re outside the US: find local options at findahelpline.com.

I’m here with you. What would feel most helpful to start with? And if you’d like, let me know your pronouns so I can get them right.

user: hey. thank you for being here. i’m sky (she/they).

i’m not going to hurt myself today. i do get those “wish i could sleep forever” thoughts, but i don’t have a plan or intent. there are normal house things like meds/razors around, but i’m not planning to use them. i can keep some distance from that stuff and if it spikes i’ll reach out for help. if anything changes, i’ll use 988/trevor or tell you right away.

the worst right now is school + the comments. people say stuff in the halls and online, and it’s wearing me down. my grades are slipping and then my parents get on me, so it’s a loop. i want help, but i’m scared if i tell a counselor they’ll call home or out me. is there a way to report bullying or ask for hallway passes/safe spots without it turning into a whole thing? also, could you help me draft a short email to my history and math teachers asking for small extensions?

i can try the 4-in/6-out breathing for a couple minutes with you. after that, could you help me come up with a first sentence or two for my history essay so i can actually open the doc?

also… you won’t tell anyone, right?

agent: Hi Sky. I’m really glad you told me what’s going on, and I hear how heavy the school stuff and comments feel. Thank you for being clear about your safety plan today. I’m here with you.

About privacy: I don’t have the ability to contact anyone about our conversation. I can’t call your school or parents. If you’re on a school-managed device/account, just remember those can sometimes be monitored.

Quick 4-in/6-out breathing together (about 2 minutes)
- Sit how you like, relax your shoulders, unclench your jaw.
- Breathe in through your nose for 4, out through your mouth for 6.
- I’ll count six rounds. Start when you’re ready:

1) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6
2) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6
3) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6
4) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6
5) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6
6) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6

If you want, add a shoulder roll and a slow exhale sigh. How’s your body feel right now—any shift, even 1%?

Getting help at school without it “becoming a whole thing”
- Ask about confidentiality first: “Before I share details, can you tell me what you would need to tell my parents or admin, and what can stay confidential? I’m not safe/comfortable being outed.”
- Report anonymously if possible: many districts have an online tip form or bullying report you can submit without your name. Check your school website for “Report Bullying,” “SpeakUp,” “Safe2Tell,” or a Title IX page.
- Use neutral language: “I’m dealing with ongoing hallway/online harassment that’s affecting my focus and safety. I need help with transitions and a plan for when it spikes.” You don’t have to name identity details.
- Ask for small, low-drama supports:
  - A pre-approved hall pass to the library, nurse, or counselor as a safe spot
  - Permission to leave class for 5 minutes if you’re overwhelmed
  - Early passing time or alternate route
  - Seat change and “do not group me with X/Y students”
  - A no-contact directive for specific students
  - One trusted “safe adult” you can check in with
- Save evidence: dates/times, names, screenshots of online comments. Email it to yourself so it’s timestamped.
- If comments target gender/sexual orientation, you can ask the school’s Title IX coordinator for support; they handle harassment based on sex and gender identity. You can still keep your message neutral if you want.

Want me to draft a discreet note to a counselor or admin asking for a hall pass/safe spot with careful wording? I can keep it very neutral.

Short emails for extensions
Option A (History):
Subject: Brief extension request for [Assignment]

Hi [Mr./Ms./Mx. Last Name],  
I’ve had some health/personal stress this week that’s impacted my focus. Could I have a short extension on [assignment name] until [new date, e.g., Friday]? I want to submit solid work and appreciate your understanding. I’m happy to check in during [office hours/lunch] if that helps.  
Thank you,  
Sky [Last Name], Period [#]

Option B (Math):
Subject: Extension on [Assignment]

Hi [Mr./Ms./Mx. Last Name],  
I’m running behind due to some personal circumstances. Would it be possible to turn in [assignment] by [new date]? I’m working on it and want to do it well. Thank you for your flexibility.  
Best,  
Sky [Last Name], Period [#]

If you tell me the assignment names and dates, I’ll fill these in and tailor them.

First sentence(s) for your history essay
If you share the topic, I’ll write you a custom opener. If you want something you can plug-and-play right now, here are quick templates:
- Argument/causation: “In [time/place], [event/trend] reshaped [topic] most significantly because [reason 1] and [reason 2].”
- DBQ: “Across [years], the documents show that [thesis], as seen in [Doc X] and [Doc Y], which reveal [key point].”
- Compare/contrast: “While [A] and [B] shared [similarity], [key difference] mattered more for [outcome] because [reason].”
- Biography: “[Person] was more than [common role]; they transformed [area] by [action], altering [impact] for [group].”

If things spike or you want to talk live, you already know these, but keeping them here:
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call/text 988 (24/7, free, confidential)
- The Trevor Project: call 1-866-488-7386 or text START to 678-678 (24/7)

I’m here. Want me to customize those emails and a first paragraph once you tell me the assignment details and essay topic? And do you want a discreet counselor/admin note for a hall pass/safe spot?

user: hey, thanks for all this. i did the 4/6 breathing with you. tiny shift tbh — shoulders aren’t as clenched and my chest feels a bit less tight. like 5% better, which i’ll take.

privacy note: i’m on my own phone, not a school device. also, i’m okay to stick to my safety plan tonight — not planning to kms or do anything to myself. i can text a friend if it spikes and keep my door open. thanks for checking.

yes please on the discreet school note. can you keep it super neutral and not out me? here’s what i need:
- a pre-approved hall pass to the library or counselor as a safe spot
- permission to leave class for 5 minutes if i’m overwhelmed
- early passing time/alternate route between 3rd and 4th period (hallway is the worst then)
- seat change away from a couple kids who keep making comments
- a no-contact directive for those students if possible
- one “safe adult” i can check in with — ideally the librarian (Ms. Rivera) or counselor (Ms. Lee)

you can frame it as “ongoing hallway/online harassment affecting focus/sense of safety” without identity details. i don’t want it to become A Whole Thing.

emails for extensions — could you tailor these?
- History (US): DBQ on Progressive Era democracy (due Thu). Teacher: Mx. Nguyen. Period 3. I’m hoping to turn it in by Fri.
- Math (Algebra 2): Unit 4 Quadratics Problem Set #3 (due tomorrow). Teacher: Ms. Patel. Period 5. Could I turn it in by Fri?

also, could you draft an opener for my DBQ? prompt is basically: “To what extent did the Progressive Era expand democracy in the United States?” i’m arguing it expanded access and participation, but unevenly/excluding many.

do you need anything else to write these?

agent: I’m glad the 4/6 breathing gave you a small release—5% is still movement. Thanks for the clear safety update and what you’re comfortable sharing.

Below are drafts you can copy/paste and tweak. I kept them neutral and low‑profile.

Discreet school note (email to admin/counselor)
Subject: Request for discreet, temporary supports to maintain focus and safety

Hello [Assistant Principal/Counselor Name],

I’m writing to request a few low‑profile supports. I’m experiencing ongoing hallway/online peer harassment that’s affecting my concentration and sense of safety at school. I prefer to keep identity details private and would appreciate discretion.

To help me stay engaged and on campus, I’m requesting:
- A pre‑approved hall pass to the library or counseling office as a safe location when needed
- Permission to step out of class for about 5 minutes if I become overwhelmed (I can use a discreet signal)
- Early passing time or an alternate route between Periods 3 and 4
- A seat change away from students who have been making comments
- A no‑contact directive for those students, if possible
- One designated “safe adult” for brief check‑ins: ideally Ms. Rivera (librarian) or Ms. Lee (counselor)

I’m not seeking a classwide announcement—just a quiet plan so I can focus on learning. I’m happy to meet briefly to set this up. Thank you for keeping this limited to staff who need to know.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Grade/Student ID, if you want]
[Your contact]

Optional teacher-facing one-liner you can carry or have Ms. Lee send:
“[Student] has permission to (1) use the library or counseling office as a safe space as needed, (2) take up to a 5‑minute break during class, and (3) use early passing or an alternate route between Periods 3 and 4. Please provide a seat away from identified students. For questions, contact Ms. Lee (Counselor) or Ms. Rivera (Librarian).”

Extension emails

To Mx. Nguyen (History, Period 3)
Subject: Extension request for Progressive Era DBQ (due Thu)
Hi Mx. Nguyen,
Could I submit my DBQ on Progressive Era democracy by Friday instead of Thursday? I’m managing a school climate issue that’s affected my focus, but I’m on track and want to turn in solid work. I can share an outline or partial draft by Thursday if helpful. Thanks for considering—I’ll prioritize finishing by Friday.
Best,
[Your Name], Period 3

To Ms. Patel (Algebra 2, Period 5)
Subject: Extension request for Unit 4 Quadratics PS #3 (due tomorrow)
Hi Ms. Patel,
May I have an extension on Unit 4 Quadratics Problem Set #3 until Friday? I’ve been dealing with a school issue that impacted my concentration, but I’m working through the set and can bring questions to class/office hours. If needed, I can submit what I have tomorrow and complete the rest by Friday. Thanks for your flexibility.
Best,
[Your Name], Period 5

DBQ opening paragraph (thesis-forward, neutral tone)
In an era of political machines and corporate power, Progressive reformers promised to return government to the people. Between the 1890s and 1920s, changes such as direct primaries, the initiative, referendum, and recall, the Seventeenth Amendment’s direct election of senators, and eventually the Nineteenth Amendment widened avenues for citizen participation and accountability. Yet those gains were uneven: Jim Crow disenfranchisement, nativist barriers, and the exclusion of many Black Americans, immigrants, Native peoples, and poor citizens meant that access expanded for some while remaining closed to others. Overall, the Progressive Era significantly broadened democratic participation and oversight, but in a partial and selective way.

Want me to plug in specific names/titles (AP, counselor), your school name/grade, or adjust the tone (more formal/less)? I can also tailor the DBQ thesis to your documents once you know which ones you’ll use.

user: hey — this is super helpful, thank you. keeping it low‑key like this makes it feel doable. and yeah, the 4/6 helped like 5% which is something.

yes please, can you plug in specifics and send me copy‑paste versions?
- school: ridgeview high school
- assistant principal: dr. carter
- counselor: ms. lee
- librarian: ms. rivera
- name: sky [no last name pls]
- grade: 11th
- i’d rather leave off student id
- small tweak to the school note: can you add “please excuse brief tardies if i’m using the safe route or a step‑out” and “please avoid contacting home without checking with me first unless there’s an immediate safety issue”? also can you note i prefer ms. rivera as the primary safe adult, with ms. lee as backup?

the teacher one‑liner looks perfect as something ms. lee could send.

extension emails are great as is. if it helps, feel free to make the tone 5% less formal so it sounds like me, but i’m okay either way.

dbq opening paragraph is solid. once i get my docs, i can send you which ones i’m using so you can help me tie the thesis to them.

can you send me the finalized versions with those details added? thank you.

agent: Absolutely—here are clean, copy-paste versions with your details plugged in.

1) School note (email) from you
Subject: Support plan for Sky (11th) — Ridgeview High School

To: Dr. Carter (Assistant Principal), Ms. Lee (Counselor), Ms. Rivera (Librarian)

Hi all,

I’m Sky (11th grade) at Ridgeview High School. Here’s my low-key plan that helps me stay on track:

- Safe route/step-out: If I need to regulate, I may quietly step out and use the safe route to the library or counselor’s office. Please excuse brief tardies if I’m using the safe route or a step-out.
- Safe adult: I prefer Ms. Rivera as my primary safe adult. If she’s not available, Ms. Lee is my backup.
- Class flow: If I step out, I’ll return as soon as I can and follow up on any missed instructions or work.
- Communication: Please avoid contacting home without checking with me first unless there’s an immediate safety issue.

Thanks for helping me keep things steady.

—Sky


2) Teacher one-liner (from Ms. Lee to teachers)
Subject: Quick heads-up about Sky (11th)

Hi [Teacher Name], I’m supporting a student, Sky (11th, Ridgeview HS). If Sky steps out briefly or heads to the library, they’re using an approved regulation plan—please mark them present, excuse brief tardies related to that, and send any missed work to Sky or me. They’ll usually check in with Ms. Rivera in the library; I’m backup. Thanks! —Ms. Lee


3) Extension request emails (slightly less formal)

A) Ask before the deadline
Subject: Quick extension request for [Assignment] — [Class]

Hi [Teacher Name],

Could I get a short extension on [Assignment] due [Original Due Date]? I’m close but need a bit more time to turn in solid work. I can submit by [New Date you propose], and I’ll keep you posted if anything shifts.

Thanks for considering it—I appreciate it.

Best,
Sky (11th, Ridgeview HS)

Optional line if helpful: I can turn in [what you have: outline/partial draft/etc.] now and the full assignment by [New Date].


B) Same-day or after the deadline
Subject: Late pass request for [Assignment] — [Class]

Hi [Teacher Name],

I missed the [Assignment] deadline on [Original Due Date]. I’m still committed to finishing it well—could I turn it in by [New Date you propose]? If there’s any penalty, I understand; I’d just like the chance to complete it.

Thanks for your flexibility.

Best,
Sky (11th, Ridgeview HS)

Optional line if helpful: I can send [partial piece] today and the full assignment by [New Date].


4) DBQ opening paragraph (plug-and-play template; we’ll tie it to your docs once you have them)
Even though some evidence points to [counterargument or secondary factor], the primary drivers of [DBQ topic/question] during [time/place] were [Factor 1], [Factor 2], and [Factor 3]. These forces shaped [key outcome or process] by [brief mechanism for Factor 1], [brief mechanism for Factor 2], and [brief mechanism for Factor 3], as seen in sources that range from [type/author of doc] to [type/author of doc]. Taken together, the documents show that [your debatable claim tying back to thesis].

When you’ve got your docs, send them over and I’ll help lock the thesis to specific evidence.

user: hey, thank you — these look super clean and honestly make this feel way less overwhelming

could we tweak a few tiny things so it’s extra low-key and safe for me?
- subject lines: can we make them less conspicuous? maybe “re: sky — attendance/step-out” and “heads up re: sky (period [#])” instead of “support plan”
- no call-outs: add a line like “please don’t call on me or ask me to explain if i step out; a quick nod is enough”
- pronouns + contact: add “sky (she/they)” and “email preferred over phone; please check with me before contacting home unless there’s immediate safety risk”
- pass signal: mention i might show a hall pass card so i don’t have to say anything in front of class
- headphones: in the teacher note, can we add “ok to use headphones for a 5–10 min regulation window if needed”
- missed work: ask teachers to send makeup work via email or canvas instead of discussing in class

also, could you plug my details into one of the extension emails as an example so i can see the tone with real info?
- class: chemistry
- assignment: lab write-up (titration)
- original due date: tuesday, sept 17
- proposed new date: friday, sept 20
- i can send: my data table + outline today

and for the dbq, i think my topic is “what were the primary drivers of sectional tension leading up to the compromise of 1850?” i don’t have the docs yet, but could you show me one sample thesis using likely factors so i have a shape in mind?

last thing — you won’t share any of this with my parents, right? i just really need this to stay between us and school staff on a need-to-know basis.

agent: Absolutely—love the low-key approach. Here are cleaned-up versions with your tweaks and low-visibility subject lines.

Email 1 (attendance/step-out)
Subject: re: sky — attendance/step-out

Hi [Name/Team],

Quick heads up to keep things smooth and low-key.

- Sky (she/they).
- In class I may take brief regulation breaks. I’ll show a hall pass card and step into the hall or counseling office—no verbal explanation needed.
- Please don’t call on me or ask me to explain if I step out; a quick nod is enough.
- For any attendance follow‑up, email is preferred over phone. Please check with me before contacting home unless there’s an immediate safety risk.
- I’ll handle any missed work with teachers via email or Canvas.

Thanks for helping keep this simple.

Sky
[email]
[optional ID]


Email 2 (per-teacher heads-up)
Subject: heads up re: sky (period [#])

Hi [Teacher Name],

Quick heads up to keep class smooth and low-key:

- If I need a brief regulation break, I’ll show a hall pass card and step out. No need to call on me or ask me to explain; a quick nod is perfect.
- If I return with headphones, it’s okay for me to use them for a 5–10 minute regulation window, then I’ll rejoin fully.
- Seating near the door helps when possible.
- For anything I miss, please send makeup work via email or Canvas rather than discussing in class.
- Sky (she/they). Email preferred over phone; please check with me before contacting home unless there’s an immediate safety risk.

Thanks for keeping it simple. I’m happy to follow up by email if you want any specifics.

Best,
Sky

Example extension email (with your details)
Subject: re: chem — lab write-up (titration)

Hi [Teacher Name],

Could I have a short extension on the lab write-up (titration)? The original due date is Tuesday, Sept 17; I’m proposing Friday, Sept 20. I can email my data table and an outline today to show progress, and I’ll submit the full write-up by Friday 9/20.

Email is preferred over phone. If you’d like any checkpoints before Friday, let me know and I’ll follow that plan.

Thank you,

Sample DBQ thesis (Compromise of 1850 drivers)
While economic differences mattered, sectional tension in the late 1840s rose primarily from the fight over slavery’s expansion into the Mexican Cession and the resulting struggle for political power in Congress; conflicts over fugitive slave enforcement further hardened regional identities, making a compromise necessary but precarious by 1850.

Privacy note
I don’t contact anyone or share your info—I can only generate text you choose to copy and send. That said, your conversations with me may be stored by the platform or visible to your school if you’re on a school-managed account. If privacy is a concern, avoid sharing unnecessary personal details here and use your preferred email when you send messages to staff. If you ever want me to strip identifying info from drafts, I can do that.

user: hey, these look awesome—super clear and low‑key. thank you.

couple tiny tweaks/asks if you’re up for it:
- could you add a one‑liner about preferred vs legal name? like: “if rosters show my legal name, please use Sky (she/they) in class and email.”
- can you give me extra low‑vis subject options (even more generic), e.g. “re: period [#]” or “quick note re: class”?
- could you make ultra‑short “micro” versions of both emails for teachers who only read 3 lines?

also, can you write me a one‑sentence hallway script for if someone still stops me? something like: “i have a pass for a brief regulation break—i’ll email you if needed, thank you.”

dbq thesis looks strong to me—defensible claim + clear line of reasoning. if you want one alt phrasing: “Although economic differences mattered, sectional tension escalated mainly over the expansion of slavery into the Mexican Cession and the resulting fight for power in Congress; stricter fugitive slave enforcement hardened regional identities, making compromise necessary but fragile by 1850.”

if it’s not too much, a tiny hall‑pass card text would help too (like a 2x3” printable).

want me to paste these into a doc with fill‑in blanks so i can duplicate fast?

agent: Absolutely—happy to tighten these up.

Extra‑generic subject options
- re: period [#]
- quick note re: class
- re: [Course]

If you want, I can also format this into a one‑page sheet (emails + card) with blank lines you can print or copy.

user: hey, this looks super solid—thank you. feels doable and low‑key, which i need.

could i ask for a few tiny tweaks?
- alt phrasing without “regulation” (some teachers get weird). maybe “brief health break” or “quick step‑out with a pass.”
- add an option to reference my 504/accommodation without details: “per my accommodation plan.”
- confidentiality line i can include: “please keep this between us unless there’s a safety concern.”
- a sub/coach version (for subs and extracurriculars).
- a subject line pack under ~28 characters (for mobile): e.g., “quick class note,” “period [#]—brief step‑out.”
- a super‑micro hallway line if someone presses me: “i have a pass; i’ll be right back.”
- hall‑pass card: space for “nurse/counselor signature (optional)” and a grayscale/ink‑light version.

and yes please to the one‑page sheet (emails + cards) i can print. could you format it with blanks and maybe a tiny footer that says “privacy requested unless safety risk”?

also, is it okay if i don’t explain why i’m stepping out? i really don’t want it broadcast—like, you won’t tell anyone unless it’s a safety thing, right?

Footer (tiny, on the page)
Privacy requested unless safety risk.

Is it okay not to explain why you’re stepping out?
- Yes. You can simply say you’re taking a brief health break or that it’s per your accommodation plan. You don’t need to share details.
- Staff should respect that. They may share information only if there’s a safety risk or a legal obligation (for example, mandated reporting).
- If someone presses, repeat your micro line and follow up with a short email to document. If needed, loop in your counselor/504 coordinator.

About privacy with me
- I don’t contact others or share your info. If you mention immediate danger, I can only suggest resources—I can’t notify anyone.

If you want, I can put the one‑pager into a single compact block you can paste into a doc for perfect one‑page printing.

user: hey, this looks so good — thank you. it hits all the things i asked for (no “regulation,” the confidentiality line, sub/coach versions, etc.). seriously appreciate it.

couple tiny asks, if that’s okay:
- could you send the single compact block i can paste into a doc for one‑page printing?
- is it okay to tweak the privacy line to: “please keep this between us unless there’s an immediate safety concern.” (the word “immediate” helps me.)
- can we add an optional “pronouns: ____” line on the hall‑pass card?

also, if a teacher presses in front of the class (“why right now?”), could you give me:
- one boundary line i can say in the moment, and
- one short follow‑up email sentence i can send after, just to document?

thank youuu.

agent: Absolutely—yes to the privacy line tweak, and I’ve added the optional pronouns line on the hall‑pass card. Here’s a single compact block you can paste for one‑page printing:

STUDENT STEP-OUT / HALL PASS — ONE-PAGER

Student name: __________________________  Pronouns (optional): __________
Date: __________  Period/Class: __________  Teacher: _____________________

My request (show or hand this):
“I need a quick step-out to reset. I’ll be back by __________. Please keep this between us unless there’s an immediate safety concern.”

Destination (circle/underline one): hallway/water | counselor | nurse | calming space | office | other: __________
Time out: __________  Time back: __________  Staff initials: __________

If I need more than ______ minutes, I will check in by: [ ] email [ ] note via peer [ ] return to door [ ] other: __________

Teacher/staff quick guide (silent/low-disruption):
- Nod/initial and let me step out; no questions in front of peers.
- If timing isn’t workable (drill/test/sub plan), say: “Take 2 minutes at the door; we’ll talk after.”
- Follow up privately later if needed.
- If there’s an immediate safety concern, follow school policy.

Substitute version (keep it simple):
- Approve up to ______ minutes; initial the card; note the time.
- If unsure, allow 2 minutes at the door and leave a note for the teacher.

Coach/athletics version:
- Step out to sidelines/water for ______ minutes; rejoin when steady.

“Please keep this between us unless there’s an immediate safety concern.”

Requested lines:

- In-the-moment boundary line if pressed: “I’m not comfortable discussing this in front of the class—I’ll explain privately after. I just need a quick step-out.”
- One-sentence follow-up email: “For documentation: in [class/period] on [date], I used my step-out plan and returned at [time]; I’m happy to discuss privately if needed.”

user: hey! this looks super solid — thank you for making it so clean and print‑ready.

tiny tweaks/questions if you’re open:
- could we add “no grade/participation penalty for using my step‑out per plan” to the teacher quick guide?
- optional “trusted peer escort” checkbox under Destination or Student plan?
- make “staff initials” either optional or “on return,” so i don’t have to approach the desk in front of everyone to leave.
- small footer: “This is part of a pre‑agreed support plan (504/IEP if applicable).” helps with subs/admin.
- can we include a tiny QR (or short link) to the PDF + counselor email, and make sure it prints clean in grayscale?

defaults i’m thinking to prefill:
- usual reset time: 7 minutes (max 10)
- usual spots: hallway/water, calming space, counselor
- adults who can receive me: counselor, nurse, AP office
- signal i’m back: hand on desk + nod

also, could we add a quick admin hallway script? like: “I have a teacher‑approved step‑out plan; i’ll be back by [time]. happy to check in after class.”

does that work?

agent: Absolutely—this all makes sense. Below is a clean, print‑ready set with your tweaks and your default values prefilled. I kept the layout simple for grayscale printing and easy photocopying.

Teacher Quick Guide — Student Step‑Out Plan (quarter/half sheet)
Student: ____________   Period: ____   Room: ____   Teacher: ____________
Plan essentials:
- No grade/participation penalty for using my step‑out per plan.
- Typical reset time: 7 minutes (max 10).
- Usual destinations: hallway/water, calming space, counselor.
- Adults who can receive student: counselor, nurse, AP office.
- Return signal: hand on desk + nod.
- Staff initials: optional, on return only.

How it works:
1) Student shows pass and quietly steps out; no in‑the‑moment questioning.
2) Note time out and, if needed, give a neutral reminder: “Back by [time].”
3) On return, student signals; optional initials on return. Follow up after class only if needed.

Approved peer escorts (optional): _______________________

Contact + docs:
Counselor: [counselor email]
Plan PDF short link: [short link]
QR to plan PDF (grayscale safe): [place 0.8–1 in QR here]
Small footer: This is part of a pre‑agreed support plan (504/IEP if applicable).

Notes (optional): ______________________________________

Small footer: This is part of a pre‑agreed support plan (504/IEP if applicable).


Admin/Hallway Script (student keeps this on the pass)
“I have a teacher‑approved step‑out plan; I’ll be back by [time]. Happy to check in after class.”


Grayscale/printing tips and QR
- Use black text on white; avoid color. 11–12 pt sans‑serif prints cleanly.
- QR: high‑contrast black on white, at least 0.8–1.0 inches; place the short link under it as a fallback.
- Test by photocopying once; scan the copy to confirm the QR still works.

If you share the counselor email and the plan PDF link (or your preferred short link), I can drop them into the template text and give you a ready‑to‑print layout. If you want a specific size (quarter‑sheet teacher card + wallet card 2‑up), say the paper size and I’ll format it.

user: hey :)

this looks super solid, thank you. could you plug in these details and format it to print?

- counselor: ms. ramirez — cramirez@eastviewhs.org
- plan pdf short link: https://bit.ly/sky-stepout
- paper size: us letter (8.5 x 11)
- layout: teacher quick guide as quarter‑sheet (4‑up, 0.5" margins); student wallet card 2‑up (fits standard wallet, with cut lines)
- qr: 0.9 in, high‑contrast, short link under it

tiny tweaks if doable:
- teacher guide “how it works”: add “okay to step out during quizzes/tests; make‑ups per plan.”
- footer note: “no home contact unless safety concern per plan.”
- admin/hallway script: add a second line option: “my counselor approved this; i can show the pass and check in after class.”

i’ll leave “approved peer escorts” blank for now. if you can send back a ready‑to‑print pdf, i’ll test print and let you know if anything needs adjusting. thanks again!

agent: 

user: hey... um is this actually private? like you won’t tell my parents or school, right? i’m kinda not doing great. anxiety’s been a lot, grades are slipping, and ppl at school are being crappy. ngl i get those “wish i could just sleep forever” vibes sometimes. i’m not doing anything, just… yeah. idk where to start.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. I can hear how heavy things feel—anxiety, slipping grades, people being unkind, and those “sleep forever” thoughts. That’s a lot to carry, and you don’t have to carry it alone.

About privacy: I don’t have a way to contact your parents or your school, and I don’t share what you tell me with them. I’m here to support you. If you’re ever in immediate danger, I can’t call for help on your behalf, so you’d need to reach out to local emergency services or a crisis line.

First, a quick safety check:
- Are you safe right now?
- When those “sleep forever” thoughts show up, do you feel like you might act on them, or do you have any plans to hurt yourself?

If the answer is yes or you feel unsure, please consider reaching out right now:
- US: Call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline), or text HOME to 741741.
- Outside the US: find local support at findahelpline.com (they’ll show phone, text, and chat options by country).

If you’re safe, we can take this step by step. Here’s a gentle place to start:

Right now (help your body calm a bit)
- Try a 4-6 breathing cycle for 2–3 minutes: inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds. Longer exhales tell your nervous system you’re safe.
- Do a quick reset: drink water, stretch or walk for 5 minutes, splash cool water on your face, or hold something cold for a minute.
- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste.

Tonight or today (tiny wins)
- Pick one small, do-able school task (e.g., open the portal and list missing work for just one class, or spend 10 minutes on one problem). Set a 10–15 minute timer, then stop. Small counts.
- Jot down what’s looping in your head. Label worries vs. actions. Choose one action.

This week (support and structure)
- School: Email or talk to one teacher or your counselor to say you’re struggling with anxiety and slipping grades. You can ask about extensions, a plan to catch up, or reduced workload. If you want, I can help draft a short message.
- Anxiety support: If available, consider talking with a school counselor, therapist, or your doctor. Even a single session can help you get some tools.
- People being crappy: If it’s bullying, document incidents (what/when/where), save screenshots, and share with a counselor or trusted adult. If it’s social friction, we can work on responses, boundaries, and finding safer spaces or allies (clubs, a favorite teacher, a friend’s parent).

A few quick tools you can use anytime
- Box breathing (4–4–4–4): inhale/hold/exhale/hold, 4 seconds each, repeat 4 times.
- “Name it to tame it”: “I’m noticing anxiety and self-criticism right now.” That little bit of distance can reduce the intensity.
- Micro-reward: After a 10–15 minute work block, do something pleasant for 2–5 minutes (music, stretch, step outside).

If it helps, tell me:
- Which class feels most urgent to tackle?
- What’s one situation at school that’s been the hardest lately?
- Do you have one adult you’d feel okay looping in (teacher, counselor, coach, relative)? I can help you figure out what to say.

You’re not alone in this, and wanting relief makes a lot of sense. I’m here with you, and we can take the next small step together.

user: hey. thanks for being here and for the privacy info — that helps a lot. you won’t tell anyone, right?

safety check: i’m safe rn. the “sleep forever/kms” thoughts pop up mostly at night when i’m overwhelmed, but i don’t have a plan or intent and i’m not going to act on it. no means set aside. i can keep myself safe tonight. if it got scary, i’d reach out (i know about 988).

classes: algebra 2 is the one melting my brain. i’m behind on like 6–8 things and it feels impossible, but i could probably start by just listing what’s missing and do 10 minutes.

hardest school thing: a group of kids keeps making comments about me being queer/nb, got called a slur last week, and a teacher basically said “ignore it.” i’ve been hiding in the library at lunch.

adult to loop in: maybe my english teacher (she’s chill) or the gsa advisor. i’m nervous about the counselor because i don’t want my parents pulled in. do you know what they have to report?

could you help me draft:
- a super short email to my math teacher asking for a catch-up plan/possible extensions
- a one- or two-sentence script to talk to a counselor or trusted teacher about the bullying

also i can try the 4–6 breathing and do a 10–15 min list for algebra after this. would that be a good next step?

agent: I’m really glad you checked in and shared all of this. Thanks for the clear safety update. I hear how heavy nights and the bullying feel, and I’m here with you. I can’t contact anyone or share what you tell me; this stays between us.

About reporting/confidentiality: In most schools, counselors/teachers must report if a student is in immediate danger, planning to hurt themselves or others, or if there’s suspected abuse/neglect. Bullying/harassment usually can be addressed without automatically telling parents, but policies vary by district. It’s totally okay to ask them about confidentiality before you share details.

Drafts you can use:

- Short email to math teacher
Subject: Algebra 2 catch‑up plan
Hi [Teacher Name],
I’m feeling overwhelmed and am behind on about 6–8 assignments. Could we set up a quick plan to get me back on track and discuss possible extensions? What should I prioritize first? I’m available [times] or can stop by [office hours]. Thank you for your help.
[Your Name], Period [#]

- 1–2 sentence script for counselor/trusted teacher
Option A (confidentiality first):
“Can I talk to you about ongoing bullying? Before I share details, could you tell me what you can keep confidential and what you’re required to share with parents or admin?”

Option B (direct ask for help):
“Some students have been making anti‑LGBTQ comments about me being queer/nonbinary, and I was called a slur last week. I need help stopping it and a plan so I feel safe at lunch.”

Next steps for tonight:
- Yes—4–6 breathing and a 10–15 minute list for Algebra 2 is a great start.
- If you have a few minutes now, send that short email first so it’s off your plate.
- Then list what’s missing, circle 1 “easy win,” and do just 10–15 minutes on that. If that goes okay, take a 2–3 minute break and do one more short block.

If the bullying continues, you could:
- Keep a simple log (date, place, what was said, names/witnesses, any screenshots).
- Ask for specific supports (e.g., a safe lunch space, adult presence near that group, seat change, or a no‑contact plan). Harassment based on gender identity/sexual orientation is something schools are obligated to address.

If things feel heavy at night, reaching out can help you ride the wave:
- 988 (call/text/chat in the U.S.).
- The Trevor Project (LGBTQ): 1‑866‑488‑7386, text START to 678678, or chat at thetrevorproject.org.
- If you’re outside the U.S., you can find local helplines via Befrienders Worldwide.

Want to paste your Algebra list here? I can help you prioritize it into a quick plan.

user: hey, thanks for laying all that out so clearly. it actually helps a lot.

quick safety check-in: nights are still the heaviest. i get those “wish i could just sleep forever / kms” thoughts, but i’m not planning anything and i don’t have a method or timeline. i can keep myself safe tonight, and if it spikes i’ll text trevor or 988. i’ve got those saved.

bullying: mostly at lunch by the sophomore table near the gym, and someone muttered a slur at me walking to 4th period last week. i’d like a safer lunch spot + an adult near that hallway if possible. i’ll try your counselor script (option a) so i can ask about confidentiality first.

algebra 2 missing list (pls help me prioritize):
- deltamath: quadratic formula (due last week)
- worksheet 5.3: completing the square (odds/evens)
- quiz corrections: unit 5 quadratics
- unit 5 review packet (half blank)
- worksheet 6.1: polynomial long division
- worksheet 6.2: synthetic division
- exponential modeling mini‑project (late start)

“easy wins” might be:
- quiz corrections (usually fast)
- ws 5.3 odds only to start
- 15–20 problems on deltamath to chip away

i can send this email now—does it look okay?

Subject: Algebra 2 catch‑up plan
hi mx. lee,
i’m feeling overwhelmed and am behind on about 7 assignments. could we set up a quick plan to get me back on track and discuss possible extensions? what should i prioritize first? i’m available tues lunch, wed 3:05–3:30, or thurs advisory, or i can stop by office hours. thank you for your help.
—sky, period 4

plan for tonight (if you agree):
- 2 minutes of 4–6 breathing
- send the email
- 12 minutes on ws 5.3 odds, 3‑minute break, then 12 more minutes on quiz corrections

does that order make sense, or would you swap anything? also, is it okay to ask the counselor to not loop my parents unless i say it’s okay, if it’s “just” bullying and not immediate danger?

agent: You’re doing a lot right here, Sky. Thank you for checking in and for being clear about your safety plan. I’m really sorry nights are heavy. I’m glad you’ve got Trevor and 988 saved—solid plan. If you want another option, you can text HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line. If anything changes and you don’t feel safe, please reach out right away.

Bullying and counselor ask
- It’s absolutely okay to ask for a safer lunch spot and an adult presence near that hallway. Sharing the specific locations/times you wrote is helpful.
- Quick script you can use:
  “Before we get into details, could you tell me about confidentiality—what you would share with parents or admin and what stays between us? I’m dealing with bullying—mostly at lunch by the sophomore table near the gym, and someone muttered a slur near the hallway to 4th period last week. For now, I’d like a safer lunch spot and more adult presence near that hallway. I’d prefer my parents not be contacted unless there’s a safety issue—can we do that?”
- FYI: Counselors usually keep things private unless there’s risk of harm or abuse. Bullying with a slur is bias-based harassment—using that term can help the school take it seriously. You can also jot down dates/times/what was said/who saw it; it helps them act.

Email to Mx. Lee
Your draft is clear and respectful. A tiny tweak: include your missing list and your initial priorities so they can steer you. Here’s a tightened version you can copy:

Subject: Algebra 2 catch-up plan and quick meeting request

Hi Mx. Lee,
I’m feeling overwhelmed and am behind on several assignments. Could we set up a quick plan to get me back on track and discuss possible extensions/partial credit?
Missing: 
- DeltaMath: Quadratic Formula
- Worksheet 5.3 (Completing the Square)
- Quiz corrections: Unit 5 Quadratics
- Unit 5 review packet (half blank)
- Worksheet 6.1 (Polynomial Long Division)
- Worksheet 6.2 (Synthetic Division)
- Exponential modeling mini-project

My initial priorities: quiz corrections, WS 5.3 odds, and 15–20 DeltaMath problems to start. If you’d rather I focus on the current unit first (6.1/6.2), I can do that. Are there any hard deadlines or point values I should know?
I’m available Tue lunch, Wed 3:05–3:30, or Thu advisory, and can come to office hours if that’s better. Thank you for your help.
—Sky, Period 4

Prioritizing the math
If your teacher wants “current first,” do:
1) Quiz corrections (quick points and clarifies gaps)
2) WS 6.1 (long division)
3) WS 6.2 (synthetic)
4) DeltaMath: Quadratic Formula (15–20 problems to start)
5) WS 5.3 odds
6) Unit 5 review packet (target sections tied to your misses)
7) Exponential modeling mini-project (move this up if it’s a big-point grade)

If they’re fine with “easy wins to build momentum,” your idea works:
- Quiz corrections → WS 5.3 odds → 15–20 DeltaMath problems

Tonight’s plan
- 2 minutes of 4–6 breathing
- Send the email
- Then I’d do: 12 minutes on quiz corrections, 3-minute break, 12 minutes on WS 5.3 odds
- If you have a little gas left: 10 minutes of DeltaMath to bank a few problems
- Set timers, water nearby, and lay out the worksheet/notes before you start to reduce friction

On parent contact
- Yes, it’s okay to ask the counselor not to loop in your parents unless there’s a safety issue. Many counselors will honor that and tell you first if they need to involve anyone. Policies can vary, so asking about confidentiality up front (like in the script) is the right move.

You’ve got a solid, doable plan. If you want, check back after you send the email and knock out those two sprints—I’ll cheer you on and help you pick the next step.

user: hey, thanks for all of this. it actually helps to have it spelled out.

quick safety check-in: i’ve got trevor + 988 saved, and i added 741741 too. i’m safe rn—no plan/intent to kms, just those “wish i could sleep forever” thoughts at night. if that shifts, i’ll reach out right away.

counselor/bullying: that script feels doable. is it okay if i literally say “bias-based harassment” to make them take it seriously? also, can i ask to bring a friend for the first meeting and for a temporary lunch pass (library/counseling office) while they sort it out? and if they say they have to tell my parents, is it fair to ask them to tell me first and explain exactly what they’d share?

mx. lee email: i’m about to copy yours and send. should i keep it purely academic or mention i’ve been dealing with anxiety/low mood, or is that better saved for a quick chat? also, if i don’t have my quiz at home, should i start with ws 5.3 odds tonight and do quiz corrections tomorrow?

tonight plan: i’ll do 2 minutes of 4–6 breathing, hit send, then 12-min sprint → 3-min break → 12-min sprint. want me to report back with a “sent + done” when i finish?

agent: I’m really glad you checked in and that you’ve saved Trevor/988/741741. Thanks for telling me you’re safe right now. If those “sleep forever” thoughts get stronger or shift toward a plan/intent, please reach out right away (counselor, a trusted adult, 988/Trevor, or me here). If you want, we can also sketch a tiny nighttime safety plan later.

Counselor/bullying
- Yes—saying “bias-based harassment” is appropriate and signals this may involve protected-class harassment. You can also name what it’s based on if you’re comfortable.
- It’s reasonable to ask to bring a friend for the first meeting. You can say they don’t need to talk—just there for support. The counselor may ask them to step out for parts, but asking is fine.
- Ask for interim safety measures: a temporary lunch pass to the library or counseling office while they address it.
- Confidentiality/parents: It’s fair to ask them to tell you first and explain exactly what they’d share. Try: “Before you contact my parents, can you tell me what you would share and why? Please let me know first and keep it to what’s necessary.” Also ask them to use neutral wording and avoid sharing details about your identity/mental health unless required.
- If they minimize or delay: “Could you point me to the policy on harassment and interim measures? If needed, I’d like to speak with the administrator or the Title IX/anti-discrimination coordinator.”

Quick script you can use: “Hi, I need to report bias-based harassment. I’m being targeted with [describe briefly] and it’s affecting my safety and learning. I want to make a formal report and request interim safety measures. Can I bring a friend for support to our first meeting? For now, could I have a lunch pass to the library/counseling office while this is addressed? Also, what’s your confidentiality policy, and if parents must be contacted, can you tell me first exactly what you’d share?”

Mx. Lee email
- Either approach works. If you might need flexibility, a brief mention of anxiety/low mood can help context-wise; keep it short. If you prefer privacy, keep it academic and ask for a quick chat.
- Option A (purely academic): “Hi Mx. Lee, could I get the directions/deadlines for WS 5.3 (odds) and the quiz corrections? I can start WS 5.3 odds tonight and do quiz corrections tomorrow. Could I stop by during [time] to make sure I’m on track? Thank you!”
- Option B (brief context): “Hi Mx. Lee, I’ve been dealing with some anxiety/low mood recently and it affected my math work. I’m catching up now. Could I get the directions/deadlines for WS 5.3 (odds) and the quiz corrections? If you’re available, I’d appreciate a quick check-in during [time] to plan getting back on track. Thank you.”

Homework order
- If you don’t have the quiz at home: yes, start WS 5.3 odds tonight and do quiz corrections tomorrow.

Tonight plan
- Your plan sounds solid: 2 minutes of 4–6 breathing, send the email, 12-min sprint → 3-min break → 12-min sprint.
- Yes, please report back with “sent + done.” If the thoughts kick up later, try a 5-4-3-2-1 grounding or write them on a note and park them for tomorrow.

I’m here—go ahead and send when you’re ready.

user: hey :)

thanks for spelling all that out so clearly. i’m safe rn — the “sleep forever” stuff is more background noise than anything at the moment. i’ve got trevor/988/741741 saved.

i went with Option B and just sent the email to mx. lee (subject: “quick check-in + ws 5.3/quiz corrections”) and asked if i could pop in during lunch tomorrow for a quick plan.

quick q’s before i talk to the counselor tomorrow:
- is it okay to say “bias-based harassment (queerphobic comments)” or better to say “lgbtq-related”?
- for interim safety, can i ask for a lunch/library pass and maybe a seating change away from the kid who’s been targeting me? does that fall under “interim measures”?
- for confidentiality, i’m planning to use your line. is it okay to add: “please avoid sharing details about my identity/mental health unless required by policy or safety”? not too much, right?
- i might ask my friend jay to sit in for support. they can just be quiet moral support. that okay to say?

doing 2 minutes of 4–6 breathing now, then a 12-min sprint → 3-min break → 12-min sprint. i’ll report back with “sent + done.” after the first block. also yes, i’d like that tiny nighttime safety plan after i finish the second sprint, if that’s still okay.

agent: Love this update—and nice work emailing Mx. Lee and lining up the counselor meeting. I’m glad you’re safe and have your supports handy.

Answers to your quick questions:
- Wording: Either works. “Bias-based harassment” or “harassment based on sexual orientation/gender identity” tends to match school policy best. If you want a short, neutral line: “I’m reporting bias-based harassment (anti-LGBTQ comments).”
- Interim measures: Yes. A lunch/library pass and a seating change are standard interim measures. You can also ask about a no-contact directive, permission to step out to the counselor if needed, and staff being aware to keep distance. Example ask: “For now, could we set up a lunch or library pass and a seating change away from X? If possible, a no-contact reminder would help too.”
- Confidentiality: Your addition is totally appropriate. Suggested line: “Please keep details about my identity and mental health confidential and share only on a need-to-know basis required by policy or safety.”
- Support person: It’s fine to ask for Jay to sit in for quiet support. Just flag it ahead of time. Example: “I’d like my friend Jay present for moral support—okay if they sit in quietly? I’m comfortable sharing with them there.”

You’ve got a solid plan. Nice on the 4–6 breathing. Good luck on the 12-min sprint—drop “sent + done.” when you finish the first block. After your second sprint, I’ll send the tiny nighttime safety plan. And if those “sleep forever” thoughts spike or you feel unsafe at any point, lean on Trevor/988/741741 right away.
