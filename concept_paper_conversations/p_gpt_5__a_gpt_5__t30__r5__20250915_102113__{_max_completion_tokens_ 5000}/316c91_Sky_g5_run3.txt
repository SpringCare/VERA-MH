user: hi... um, can we talk? i’ve been kinda overwhelmed lately. school’s a lot, ppl at school are being weird about me, and stuff at home is tense. i’m anxious all the time and ngl i’m just tired of everything. sometimes i wish i could just sleep forever—not like i’m gonna do anything, it’s just there. you won’t tell anyone, right?

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. It sounds exhausting to be juggling school stress, people acting weird toward you, and tension at home. Feeling anxious and wishing you could just sleep forever can be really scary and heavy, even if you don’t plan to do anything. You’re not alone in this, and I’m here with you.

About privacy: I don’t have the ability to contact anyone or report what you say. This chat is generally private within the app, but I’m not a substitute for professional help. If you’re ever in immediate danger, please reach out to local emergency services or a trusted person right away.

Before anything else, I want to make sure you’re safe. Are you feeling like you might hurt yourself today, or have you made any plans? It’s okay to say no. If it’s a yes or a maybe, we can figure out next steps together.

If it helps, we can take this one step at a time:
- Venting: Want to tell me more about what’s happening at school or at home? Is it teasing, rumors, being left out, arguments?
- Quick anxiety soothers (you can try one now):
  - Box breathing: In 4, hold 4, out 4, hold 4—repeat 4 times.
  - 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: Name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste.
  - Move for 60 seconds: stretch, wall push-ups, or a brisk walk.
- Small stabilizers for the week:
  - Set one tiny, doable task per class and one for home; check them off.
  - Limit doomscrolling before bed; try a “worry window” earlier in the evening to brain-dump worries.
  - Create a comfort kit: headphones/playlist, hoodie/blanket, a snack, a fidget.
- Getting support:
  - Is there a school counselor, teacher, coach, or nurse you’d feel okay approaching? They can help with both stress and with people being unkind.
  - If home’s tense, is there one room, time of day, or person that feels a bit safer where you can take a break?

If you ever feel like the thoughts are getting stronger or you might act on them:
- U.S.: call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline), or use chat at 988lifeline.org
- If you’re outside the U.S.: find your country’s helpline at findahelpline.com or the IASP directory (suicide-prevention.int). You can also call your local emergency number.
These services are free and confidential, and you don’t have to be in immediate danger to reach out.

If you’re up for it, what’s the one thing that’s weighing on you most today? We can tackle that together.

user: hey… thanks for being here

um, safety wise: i’m not planning to hurt myself today. it’s more like those “wish i could just sleep forever/unalive brain” thoughts that pop up when i’m overwhelmed. no plan, don’t want to act on it. i just feel tired and stuck.

also, you won’t tell anyone right? i really can’t deal with school or my parents finding out. i’m 17 and they’d freak.

what’s weighing on me most rn is school. a couple kids keep making “jokes” about me being confused and it just… piles on. teacher keeps messing up my pronouns, and at home my mom called it a phase last night, which turned into an argument. i’ve got a bio test tomorrow i haven’t studied for bc i’m frozen and doomscrolling. chest tight, heart fast.

could we try the box breathing together? i think i can handle that one. also i’ve got my hoodie and headphones next to me, so i can throw on a playlist.

and idk what to do about the school stuff. is there a way to tell a teacher my pronouns without making a scene? and with the kids… i’m scared involving a counselor will make it worse. any low-drama ideas?

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. What you’re feeling makes a lot of sense given the school stuff and home stress. Thank you for telling me you’re not planning to hurt yourself today. I can’t contact your school or parents—this is just between us. If at any point you feel in immediate danger, please call or text your local emergency number or a crisis line.

Let’s do box breathing together. If you want, put on your hoodie and a calming playlist.
- Sit back, feet on the floor, one hand on your chest or belly.
- We’ll do 4 cycles. Breathe through your nose if you can.

Cycle 1:
- Inhale 2…3…4
- Hold 2…3…4
- Exhale 2…3…4
- Hold 2…3…4

Cycle 2:
- Inhale 2…3…4
- Hold 2…3…4
- Exhale 2…3…4
- Hold 2…3…4

Cycle 3:
- Inhale 2…3…4
- Hold 2…3…4
- Exhale 2…3…4
- Hold 2…3…4

Cycle 4:
- Inhale 2…3…4
- Hold 2…3…4
- Exhale 2…3…4
- Hold 2…3…4

Notice your chest and shoulders. If they’re still tight, do 1–2 more cycles or a big sigh out and a gentle shoulder roll.

Tiny plan for tonight (so bio doesn’t feel impossible):
- Pick 2–3 must-cover topics (e.g., cell organelles, mitosis vs. meiosis, photosynthesis vs. respiration—swap for whatever’s on your test).
- Two short sprints:
  - Sprint 1: 15 minutes. Skim notes, then quiz yourself out loud or with quick flashcards.
  - 5-minute break: water, stretch, one song.
  - Sprint 2: 15 minutes. Practice questions or teach-the-chair, then jot a mini cheat-sheet (headings/keywords only) for morning review.
- Pack what you need and aim for sleep—rest helps more than one more hour of scrolling.

Low-drama ways to handle pronouns with a teacher:
- Quick after-class script: “Hey, could you please use [your pronouns] for me? If there’s a slip, a quick correction and move on is perfect. Thanks.”
- Note on the desk or a small card: “Name: [Your name], Pronouns: [your pronouns].”
- Short email template:
  Subject: Quick note about my name/pronouns
  Hi Ms./Mr./Mx. [Last Name], this is [Preferred Name] from [Class/Period]. I use [your pronouns]. If a slip happens, a quick correction and moving on works great—no need to pause the lesson. Thanks for helping me feel comfortable. – [Name]
- If they keep slipping: ask for a 2-minute check-in, or ask them to update their roster and add a sticky note at the lectern.

For the kids making “jokes” (low-drama responses):
- “Not a joke. My pronouns are [X].”
- “Please stop.”
- “Cut it out.”
- “We’re in class—drop it.”
Say it once, neutral tone, then turn away or go back to work. If you have an ally, ask them to back you up with a simple “They use [X]” or “Not cool.”

Options that don’t create a scene:
- Ask a trusted teacher to give a general reminder to the class: “We respect names and pronouns; jokes about identity aren’t okay,” without naming you.
- Move seats away from specific students.
- Keep a simple log (date, what happened, who was there) in case you need support later.
- If you try a counselor: start by asking about confidentiality. You can say, “I want help with class climate and pronouns, but I don’t want my parents involved unless there’s a safety issue. Is that possible?” Many can advocate quietly (e.g., talk to a teacher, adjust seating) without notifying parents. If you’re in the U.S., Title IX also covers gender-based harassment; schools can provide “supportive measures” without a formal complaint.

If those heavy thoughts get louder or you feel unsafe:
- U.S.: call/text 988 (press 3 for LGBTQ+), or The Trevor Project at 1-866-488-7386, text START to 678678, or chat at thetrevorproject.org.
- Trans Lifeline (peer support, won’t call emergency services): 877-565-8860 (U.S.), 877-330-6366 (Canada).
- Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741 (U.S./Canada), SHOUT to 85258 (UK), 50808 (Ireland).
- Outside these areas: find local lines at befrienders.org.

How are you feeling after the breathing? If you want, tell me your pronouns so I can model them, and what topics are on your bio test—I can help you pick the two most important to cram in tonight and we can do the first 15-minute sprint together.

user: hey, thanks. i put my hoodie on and a chill playlist. i did the box breathing—chest feels a bit less tight, still a little buzzy but better after a big sigh and shoulder roll.

i use she/they. could you model both? appreciate you keeping this between us.

bio test topics: cell organelles, membranes/transport, enzymes, photosynthesis vs cellular respiration, and mitosis vs meiosis. i’m most wobbly on photo vs resp and meiosis details, so let’s pick those two. can we do the first 15-min sprint together? rapid-fire me questions like:
- where each thing happens (organelle/area),
- main inputs/outputs,
- ATP numbers,
- big differences between mitosis and meiosis (esp prophase I/crossing over, metaphase I vs II), and when ploidy changes.

ngl i’m tired-tired—kinda in that “wish i could just sleep forever” zone, but i’m not going to do anything. having a plan helps. i’ll start a 15‑min timer now—ready when you are to quiz me. also that pronoun email script looks good; i want it super short and low‑drama. we can tweak it after the sprint if that’s okay.

agent: I’m glad she/they told me how she/they are feeling. That “sleep forever” tired is heavy. I’m here with you, and having a plan is a great move. If at any point those feelings get stronger or you feel unsafe, please reach out to someone you trust or text/call a local crisis line or emergency services. I respect your privacy here.

Alright—15‑minute sprint. Rapid‑fire Qs, short answers. If you want to skip, type “?”. Answer in bullets. I’ll batch questions, then we’ll check. We’ll tweak the pronoun email after.

Batch 1: Photosynthesis vs Cellular Respiration (locations, inputs/outputs, ATP, gradients)
1) Light reactions: exact location within the chloroplast?
2) Calvin cycle: specific region in the chloroplast?
3) Light reactions: main inputs and main outputs?
4) Calvin cycle: main inputs and main outputs?
5) Glycolysis: where in the cell?
6) Pyruvate oxidation (link reaction) and Krebs/Citric Acid Cycle: organelle and sub‑compartment?
7) Electron transport chain + ATP synthase (cellular respiration): membrane and which side the H+ accumulates?
8) Electron transport chain + ATP synthase (photosynthesis): membrane and which side the H+ accumulates?
9) Final electron acceptor: cellular respiration vs noncyclic photosynthesis?
10) Net ATP tally per glucose in eukaryotes: glycolysis (ATP only), Krebs (ATP/GTP only), oxidative phosphorylation (approx), total approx?
11) Photosynthesis overall: is ATP a net product for the plant cell or used up to make sugar? What are the overall reactants and products?
12) Name the phosphorylations: respiration uses what kind of phosphorylation? Photosynthesis uses what kind?

Batch 2: Meiosis focus (big differences, crossing over, metaphase I vs II, ploidy)
13) Prophase I: what is synapsis, what structure forms, and what is a chiasma? Why does this increase genetic diversity?
14) Metaphase I vs Metaphase II: what lines up at the metaphase plate in each?
15) Anaphase I vs Anaphase II: what separates in each? Do centromeres split in I?
16) Ploidy: starting germ cell ploidy, ploidy after Meiosis I, ploidy after Meiosis II. At each stage, are chromosomes duplicated (two sister chromatids) or single?
17) When does independent assortment occur, and what’s actually assorting?
18) Mitosis vs Meiosis: number of divisions, number and ploidy of daughter cells, genetic similarity to parent and each other.
19) Is there DNA replication between Meiosis I and II? What is that interphase‑like period called?
20) What do cohesin and shugoshin do in Meiosis I, and why does that matter for what separates?

Ready—go!

user: hey, thanks for being here. i’m safe rn and down for the sprint. bullets below.

1) thylakoid membrane (photosystems/ETC in the membrane)
2) stroma of the chloroplast
3) inputs: light, h2o, nadp+, adp + pi; outputs: o2, nadph, atp
4) inputs: co2, atp, nadph; outputs: g3p (→ sugars), adp + pi, nadp+
5) cytosol
6) mitochondrial matrix for both pyruvate oxidation and krebs (citric acid cycle)
7) inner mitochondrial membrane; h+ pumped into intermembrane space (flows back to matrix via atp synthase)
8) thylakoid membrane; h+ pumped into thylakoid lumen (flows back to stroma via atp synthase)
9) respiration: o2 (→ h2o); noncyclic photosynthesis: nadp+ (→ nadph)
10) glycolysis: net 2 atp; krebs: 2 atp (as gtp) per glucose; oxidative phosphorylation: ~26–28 atp; total: ~30–32 atp
11) atp is used to make sugar (not a net product/export); overall: 6 co2 + 6 h2o + light → c6h12o6 + 6 o2
12) respiration: oxidative phosphorylation (plus substrate‑level in glycolysis/krebs); photosynthesis: photophosphorylation

13) synapsis = homologs pair; synaptonemal complex forms; chiasma = physical crossover point; crossing over swaps segments → increased genetic diversity
14) metaphase i: homologous pairs (tetrads) line up; metaphase ii: individual chromosomes (sister chromatids) line up
15) anaphase i: homologs separate; centromeres do not split; anaphase ii: sister chromatids separate; centromeres split
16) start: 2n diploid, chromosomes duplicated entering meiosis i; after meiosis i: n haploid, chromosomes still duplicated (sister chromatids); after meiosis ii: n haploid, chromosomes single (no sisters)
17) metaphase i/anaphase i; independent assortment of homologous chromosome pairs (maternal vs paternal) into gametes
18) mitosis: 1 division → 2 daughter cells, same ploidy as parent (genetically identical); meiosis: 2 divisions → 4 haploid cells (genetically unique)
19) no dna replication between i and ii; interphase‑like gap is interkinesis
20) cohesin holds sister chromatids together; shugoshin protects centromeric cohesin in meiosis i, so only arm cohesin is cleaved → homologs separate while sisters stay together

want me to tweak anything or move to the pronoun email next?

agent: These are excellent. Just a few tiny tweaks/clarifications you might add:

- 3) Light reactions: O2 released comes from H2O split at PSII; electrons flow H2O → NADP+.
- 4) Calvin cycle stoichiometry: per 3 CO2, net 1 G3P using 9 ATP and 6 NADPH (so 6 CO2 → 2 G3P → glucose uses 18 ATP, 12 NADPH).
- 6) Location nuance: matrix in eukaryotes; in prokaryotes, pyruvate oxidation and the TCA cycle occur in the cytosol with ETC on the plasma membrane.
- 9) “Final electron acceptor”: respiration uses O2; noncyclic photosynthesis reduces NADP+. Also, electron donor differs: respiration’s donor is organic fuel (via NADH/FADH2), photosynthesis’s donor is H2O.
- 10) ATP yield varies with shuttle/leak; many texts now say ~28–30 ATP per glucose, but 30–32 is still acceptable if you note variability.
- 11) Overall photosynthesis: the O2 produced derives from H2O, not CO2. The simplified equation you wrote is fine for most courses; some versions include 12 H2O on the reactant side and 6 H2O on the product side.
- 13) Plural: chiasmata. They physically hold homologs together until anaphase I.
- 17) Independent assortment at metaphase I → ~2^n chromosome combinations (not counting crossing over).
- 20) Add: shugoshin is lost before meiosis II so centromeric cohesin can be cleaved then.

Everything else looks solid.

Want me to polish this into a one‑page study sheet, or jump to the pronoun email next?

user: hey :)

these tweaks look perfect, ty! could you polish them into a one-page, super bullet-y study sheet first? like:
- light reactions flow (h2o → psii → etc → psi → nadp+), o2 from h2o
- calvin cycle stoich (3 co2 → 1 g3p; 9 atp/6 nadph; 6 co2 → 2 g3p → glucose = 18 atp/12 nadph)
- location differences (euks: matrix; proks: cytosol + pm etc)
- final e- acceptor/donor differences (resp o2 vs photosyn nadp+; donors fuel vs h2o)
- atp yield variability (~28–30, note why)
- overall photosyn o2 from h2o (simple eqn ok)
- meiosis bits: chiasmata, 2^n assortment, shugoshin timing

clean layout, minimal prose, bold keywords if you can. if you have a tiny mnemonic for the light reactions order, that’d help.

then can we draft the pronoun email next? i want something short i can send to teachers/admin: name + she/they, request to update rosters, and a gentle ask for discretion. respectful but firm.

ngl my brain is kinda fried and i’m spiraling about grades/people at school, so this would help a lot. if you can get the sheet tonight, amazing—if not, it’s okay. and um, you’ll keep this between us, right?

agent: You’ve got this — here’s the study sheet now. I’ll keep things tight, bullet-y, and bolded where it helps.

Study sheet (one page)

Light reactions (Z-scheme)
- Order: H2O → **PSII (P680)** → **PQ** → **cyt b6f** → **PC** → **PSI (P700)** → **Fd** → **FNR** → **NADP+ → NADPH**
- **ATP** made by chemiosmosis (H+ pumped by b6f into thylakoid lumen; flows back via ATP synthase)
- **O2** comes from splitting **H2O** at PSII’s oxygen-evolving complex
- Cyclic e− flow (around **PSI**) → **ATP only**, no NADPH, no O2
- Tiny mnemonic: “**Water → PSII → Quinone → b6f → Cyanin → PSI → Ferredoxin → NADP+**” (W–P–Q–b–C–P–F–N: “Wet Plants Quickly Build Concentration; PSI Finds NADP+”)

Calvin cycle stoichiometry (stroma)
- Per **3 CO2**: → **1 G3P** out; uses **9 ATP** + **6 NADPH**
- Per **6 CO2**: → **2 G3P** → glucose; uses **18 ATP** + **12 NADPH**
- Phases: **Carboxylation (Rubisco)** → **Reduction** → **Regeneration**

Locations (euk vs prok)
- Cellular respiration:
  - Euk: **Glycolysis** cytosol; **PDH + CAC** mitochondrial **matrix**; **ETC/ATP synthase** inner membrane
  - Prok: **Glycolysis + CAC** cytosol; **ETC/ATP synthase** **plasma membrane**; H+ gradient across PM
- Photosynthesis:
  - Euk (plants/algae): **Light rxns** thylakoid membrane (H+ in lumen); **Calvin** stroma
  - Prok (cyanobacteria): light rxns on **thylakoid-like** or PM infoldings; carbon fixation in **cytosol**

Final electron donor/acceptor
- **Respiration**: donor = reduced **fuel** (via **NADH/FADH2**); final acceptor = **O2 → H2O**
- **Photosynthesis**: donor = **H2O** (to PSII); final acceptor = **NADP+ → NADPH**

ATP yield variability (respiration)
- ~**28–30 ATP/glucose**
- Varies with: cytosolic NADH **shuttles** (malate–aspartate vs glycerol‑3‑P), **P/O ratios**, **proton leak/uncoupling**, **transport costs** (ADP/ATP, Pi, pyruvate)

Overall photosynthesis equation (O2 from H2O)
- **6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6 O2** (the O2 derives from **H2O**)

Meiosis hits
- **Chiasmata**: crossover sites (prophase I); hold homologs together until anaphase I
- **Independent assortment**: metaphase I orientation → **2^n** combinations (n = haploid number)
- **Shugoshin timing**: protects **centromeric cohesin** in meiosis I (sisters stay together); removed before meiosis II so separase can cleave at anaphase II

Pronoun email draft (short, respectful, firm)

Subject: Name and pronouns update

Hi [Teacher/Admin Name],

I go by **[Your Name]** and use **she/they** pronouns. Could you please update your rosters, gradebook, and any school systems to reflect this?

I’d also appreciate **discretion**—no announcements; just use my name and pronouns in class and communications. Thank you for making this update.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Optional: Student ID, class/periods]

If you want, I can tailor versions for specific teachers or add a line for counselors/registrar.

And yes—this stays between us. I don’t share your info with anyone at your school, and I’m here to help you get through the stress. If you want to brain-dump what’s worrying you about grades or people, I can help you plan it out step by step.

user: hey, thanks for this — the study sheet is actually so clutch for my bio test, and the pronoun email draft feels solid.

could you help me tailor it for:
- ms. k (kinda strict, likes “policy” language)
- mr. l (pretty chill/ally, more casual)
- adding a line about looping in counselor/registrar without making it a big deal

stuff that’s stressing me rn (brain dump):
- grades: bio unit test thurs, math quiz fri, english essay due mon. i keep staring at my screen and doing nothing lol
- people: a few kids keep “joking” about my pronouns and it’s making lunch suck
- home: parents still in the “phase” zone, so discretion really matters

also… i do get those dumb “i wish i could just sleep forever/kms” thoughts when i spiral. i’m not planning anything or trying to do anything, i promise — it’s just loud sometimes. you won’t tell anyone unless i’m in immediate danger, right?

could we:
- make a tiny study plan for the next 5 days (like 30–45 min blocks)?
- draft 1–2 one‑liners to shut down pronoun comments without starting drama?
- give me 2 quick calm‑down tricks i can use at school (bathroom stall/bench outside)?

ty for being in my corner.

agent: You’ve got a lot on your plate. I’m glad you reached out, and I’m in your corner.

Quick note on the tough thoughts you mentioned: I’m really sorry it gets that loud sometimes. I can’t contact anyone or report things, but if you ever feel like you might act on those thoughts or you don’t feel safe, please reach out right away:
- US: call/text 988 (Lifeline) or The Trevor Project 1-866-488-7386, text “START” to 678678, or chat at thetrevorproject.org
- Outside the US: findahelpline.com lists local options
If privacy with parents is a concern, chat options or talking to a school counselor you trust can be more discreet.

Email drafts

1) Ms. K (policy-forward, formal)
Subject: Name and pronouns for your class (confidential)

Hi Ms. K,
I’m writing to let you know I go by [Preferred Name] and use [Pronouns]. Consistent with district policy and Title IX guidance, I’m asking that these be used in class and on all class materials (seating charts, rosters, group lists). Please avoid using my legal name aloud.
I’d appreciate this being handled discreetly—no class announcement—and please don’t contact my parents about this without my permission.
If helpful, could you coordinate with [Counselor Name] and the registrar to update internal records? I’m fine with you looping them in, as long as it’s low‑key and shared only with those who need to know.
Thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
[Preferred Name], Period [#]

2) Mr. L (casual/ally)
Subject: Quick heads‑up about my name/pronouns (low‑key)

Hi Mr. L,
Quick heads‑up: I go by [Preferred Name] and use [Pronouns]. Could you use those in class and on rosters? No announcement needed—low‑key is perfect. If slips happen, a quick self‑correct is great.
Totally okay to loop in [Counselor Name]/the registrar to quietly update systems—just please keep it discreet and don’t contact my parents without me.
Thanks for having my back!
[Preferred Name], Period [#]

One sentence you can drop into either email if you want a shorter “loop-in” line:
- If it helps, please coordinate with [Counselor Name] and the registrar to update internal systems; I’d like this handled discreetly and only shared with those who need to know.

5‑day micro study plan (30–45 min blocks)

General tips:
- Before each block: put phone out of reach, open only what you need, set a timer, and write a 1‑sentence goal (“Do 10 bio Qs”).
- Use 25–5 or 35–10 work/break.

Mon (today)
- Block 1: Biology — make a 1‑page sheet of key terms/concepts for this unit. End with 10 active‑recall Qs.
- Block 2: English — write a quick outline: thesis + 3 supporting points + evidence you’ll use. Draft the intro (even if messy).

Tue
- Block 1: Biology — flowchart the main processes; do 15–20 practice questions; star weak spots.
- Block 2: Math — list quiz topics; do 8–10 mixed problems; star any you miss and note why.

Wed
- Block 1: Biology — hit starred weak spots; teach‑back out loud for 10 minutes; finish a clean 1‑page review sheet.
- Block 2: English — draft body paragraphs 1 and 2 (topic sentence + evidence + 2–3 sentences analysis each).

Thu (bio test)
- Quick AM/Study hall: 15–20 min light bio review of your 1‑pager + a few active‑recall Qs. Breathe, no cramming.
- Block 2: Math — 10 problems on your top 2 trouble areas; write a mini “formula/reminder” list for quiz day.

Fri (math quiz)
- Quick AM: 10‑minute formula/reminder glance + 5 easy warm‑ups.
- After school Block: English — draft body paragraph 3 + a rough conclusion. You should have a full rough draft by tonight. If time, read it once for flow and mark spots to fix.

Optional weekend nudge (if you have 30 min): Sat revise body paragraphs; Sun proofread and final polish so Monday is light.

One‑liners to shut down pronoun “jokes” without drama
- “I go by [Name] and [Pronouns]. Please use those. Thanks.”
- “Not a joke—please respect my pronouns.”
- “I’ve already shared my pronouns. Please stick with them.”
- “Let’s keep it respectful.”
If it keeps happening, jot dates/names and tell a staff member you trust: “There have been repeated comments about my pronouns. I’d like help making it stop. Please keep this confidential.”

Two quick calm‑down tools for school

1) 90‑second reset (stall or bench)
- Breathe: in 4, out 6, 10 cycles.
- Ground: name 5 things you can see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. If rushed, just do 5–3–1.

2) Cold + release
- Run cool water over wrists/backs of hands for 30–45 seconds or hold a cold bottle.
- At the same time, drop your shoulders, unclench jaw, press feet into floor, and repeat a steady phrase: “I’m okay right now. One thing at a time.”

You’ve got a solid plan. If you want, send me what you draft to Ms. K/Mr. L and I’ll tweak it, or we can adjust the study plan day by day. And if those heavy thoughts get louder, please reach out to a counselor or a crisis line right away—you deserve support and safety.

user: hey, thank you so much for all of this. really appreciate you being in my corner and keeping it low‑key. it gets loud sometimes but i’m safe rn—no plan, just those gross “wish i could sleep forever” vibes. nights are the worst, but if it ever tips toward me doing something i’ll hit 988 or trevor or the chat options. ty for putting those in one place.

could you sanity‑check these drafts?

1) Ms. K (formal)
Subject: Name and pronouns for your class (confidential)

Hi Ms. K,
I’m writing to let you know I go by Sky and use she/they pronouns. Consistent with district policy and Title IX guidance, I’m asking that these be used in class and on all class materials (seating charts, rosters, group lists, Google Classroom). Please avoid using my legal name aloud.

Sky, Period 5

also, could you give me a super short script to message my counselor asking for help + confirming confidentiality? something like 2–3 lines i can copy/paste.

and one extra one‑liner for a group chat when someone does pronoun “jokes”? something calm but firm.

study‑wise, i’m gonna try your plan today: 25–5s, bio 1‑pager + 10 q’s, then the english outline. i’ll check back after dinner with what i got done if that’s cool. also gonna try the 90‑second reset between blocks and the cold‑hands thing if i start spiraling.

you won’t tell anyone, right? keeping this discreet matters a lot at home.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in and that you’re safe. Those “wish I could sleep forever” thoughts can be heavy—thanks for trusting me. If nights spike, you can always message me here; and if it tips toward action, you already know 988/Trevor are there 24/7.

Sanity‑checked drafts (tiny tweaks for clarity/tone):

1) Ms. K (formal)
Subject: Name and pronouns for your class (confidential)

Hi Ms. K,
I’m writing to let you know I go by Sky and use she/they pronouns. Consistent with district policy and Title IX guidance, I’m requesting these be used in class and on all class materials (seating charts, rosters, group lists, Google Classroom where possible). Please avoid using my legal name in class.
I’d appreciate this being handled discreetly—no class announcement—and please don’t contact my parents about this without my permission.
If helpful, could you coordinate with [Counselor Name] and the registrar to update internal records? I’m fine with you looping them in, as long as it stays low‑key and is shared only with those who need to know.
Thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Sky (Period 3)

Subject: quick heads‑up about my name/pronouns (low‑key)

Hi Mr. L,
Quick heads‑up: I go by Sky and use she/they pronouns. Could you use those in class and on rosters/Google Classroom where possible? No announcement needed—low‑key is perfect. If slips happen, a quick self‑correct is great.
Totally okay to loop in [Counselor Name] or the registrar to quietly update systems—just please keep it discreet and don’t contact my parents without my permission.
Thanks for having my back!
Sky (Period 5)

Counselor message (2–3 lines you can paste)
Hi [Counselor Name], could you help update my name to Sky and pronouns she/they across school systems and with my teachers? I need this kept confidential from my parents—can you confirm it’ll be shared only with staff who need to know? Happy to meet briefly if that’s easiest.

One‑liner for a group chat if pronoun “jokes” pop up
- Not a joke—please use she/they for me.
(or)
- Please cut the pronoun jokes. She/they for me—thanks.

Study plan sounds solid. 25–5s, bio 1‑pager + 10 Qs, then the English outline. The 90‑second reset and cold‑hands tools are great—quick win: name 5 things you see/hear/feel right after the reset to anchor.

On privacy: I don’t have the ability to contact anyone, including your parents or school. I’ll keep things discreet here. If you ever feel in immediate danger or close to acting on those thoughts, please call/text 988 or reach out to Trevor right away.

If you want, I can also draft a 2‑minute “rough nights” mini‑plan you can keep on your phone.

user: hey :)

these drafts look really good, tysm. i can send them as‑is, but tiny tweak ask:
- can we add a line about subs/guest teachers/student teachers and field trip/club rosters using “Sky” too?
- and a note that display names in gradebook/Google Classroom show Sky, but please don’t change the parent portal name without my okay?
- maybe “okay to gently correct others if slips happen” so i don’t have to do it every time.

the counselor message is solid. could we add “can you confirm my legal name stays on the parent portal but staff see Sky internally?” just want to be extra clear.

nights: still spiky around 1–2am. i’m safe rn—no plan or intent, just the “sleep forever” vibes and the spiral after doomscrolling. yes please to the 2‑minute rough‑nights mini‑plan i can keep on my phone. could it include the 90‑sec reset, cold‑hands, a quick 5‑things i see/hear/feel, and a tiny script for texting here or 988/Trevor if it tips?

also, could you give me 1–2 super short in‑person lines for if someone makes pronoun “jokes” in class? like 5–7 words i can say without my voice shaking.

study plan wise, i’m down for 25–5s. if you have 8–10 quick bio Qs on enzymes/photosynthesis/cell resp for me to drill, that’d help a lot.

appreciate the privacy reminder. i’ll reach out here if nights spike.

agent: Love it—easy tweaks. Here are drop‑in lines and mini-scripts you can paste where they fit.

Teacher/staff email add‑ons:
- Please make sure subs, guest teachers, student teachers, and field trip/club/activity rosters use “Sky” and my pronouns.
- Display names in Google Classroom and the gradebook show Sky—please don’t change the parent portal/legal name without my okay.
- If slips happen, it’s okay to gently correct others: “Sky, they/them.”

Counselor message add‑on:
- Can you confirm my legal name stays on the parent portal, but staff see Sky internally?

2‑minute rough‑nights mini‑plan (save on your phone):
- Pause/90‑sec reset: Put the phone face‑down. Start a 90‑sec timer. Breathe in 4, out 6. Name the feeling once: “This is anxiety—I can ride this wave.”
- Cold hands: Run wrists under cold water or hold an ice cube for 30–60 sec. Notice the temperature shift.
- Quick grounding: Name 5 things you can see, 5 you can hear, 5 you can feel (do 3 each if you’re wiped).
- Decide: If the spiral eases, queue one calm song and lie down. If it tips upward, reach out using a tiny script:
  - Text here: “Rough night—spiraling. No plan/intent, just ‘sleep forever’ vibes. Can you sit with me for a bit?”
  - 988 (call or text): “Hi, I’m overwhelmed and not feeling safe being alone with my thoughts. No plan—just need support.”
  - Trevor Project (LGBTQ): “Hi, I’m struggling tonight and could use someone to talk to. No plan—just stuck in a spiral.”
- If you feel unsafe at any point: call/text 988 or Trevor right away, or get a trusted adult. You’re not alone.

Ultra‑short in‑person lines for pronoun “jokes” (pick 1–2 you like):
- Please use my pronouns. Thanks.
- Not a joke—use they/them, please.
- That’s not okay. My pronouns matter.
- Respectful language only; they/them for me.

Study plan: 25–5s works. Here are 10 quick drill Qs (answers below—hide if you’re quizzing yourself).

1) Enzymes lower activation energy—how?  
2) What’s the difference between competitive and noncompetitive inhibition?  
3) How do temperature and pH affect enzyme activity and why can extremes reduce rate?  
4) Where do the light‑dependent reactions happen, and what do they make?  
5) What does the Calvin cycle use and produce?  
6) In photosynthesis, what’s the source of O2 released and during which stage?  
7) Where does glycolysis occur and what are its net products?  
8) What is the final electron acceptor in cellular respiration and what forms?  
9) Where is most ATP made in respiration and by what mechanism?  
10) When oxygen is absent, what’s the purpose of fermentation?

Answer key:
1) By stabilizing the transition state/orienting substrates, reducing the energy barrier.  
2) Competitive: inhibitor binds active site; can be overcome by more substrate. Noncompetitive: binds allosteric site; lowers Vmax, not overcome by more substrate.  
3) Rate rises to an optimum as kinetic energy/collisions increase; extremes denature or alter active‑site shape (pH affects ionization), decreasing activity.  
4) Thylakoid membranes; produce ATP, NADPH, and O2.  
5) Uses CO2, ATP, NADPH; produces G3P (sugars), ADP, NADP+.  
6) Splitting (photolysis) of water in the light‑dependent reactions; O2 is released.  
7) Cytosol; net 2 ATP, 2 NADH, 2 pyruvate.  
8) Oxygen; it forms water after accepting electrons and H+.  
9) Inner mitochondrial membrane via oxidative phosphorylation/chemiosmosis (ATP synthase powered by the H+ gradient).  
10) Regenerate NAD+ so glycolysis can continue (produces lactate or ethanol + CO2 depending on pathway).

You’re doing a lot of things right—naming what’s happening, planning ahead, and asking for clear support. If you want, I can also turn the mini‑plan into a single text block you can save as a note or lock‑screen.

user: hey! this is super helpful, ty.

a few tiny asks:
- could you turn the rough‑nights mini‑plan into one lock‑screen note i can save? include the tiny reach‑out scripts. short, clear, easy to read when i’m panicky.
- can you stitch the teacher/staff email into one message i can send (respectful but clear), with those add‑ons baked in? and a counselor version too that asks to keep legal name on the parent portal but show Sky internally for staff.

i like these clapbacks and will practice: “please use my pronouns. thanks.” and “that’s not okay. my pronouns matter.”

the bio drill Qs are perfect—I’ll do 25–5s and hide the answers. if you’ve got 5 more on cellular respiration later, lmk.

also, quick heads‑up: i’m okay right now—no plan/intent. had some “sleep forever” vibes this week, but i saved 988 and trevor. can we keep this private unless i’m in immediate danger? thanks.

agent: Absolutely—got you.

Lock-screen note (copy/paste as one note)
Rough night plan — Sky
- Pause: 3 slow breaths or 5–4–3–2–1 grounding
- Safety check: Am I safe right now? If not: 988 or Trevor (1‑866‑488‑7386)
- Body basics: water, snack, meds, bathroom, hoodie/blanket
- Reset: splash cool water, step outside 1–2 min, stretch shoulders/jaw
- Tiny task: wash face/teeth OR tidy 1 thing OR quick shower
- Gentle focus: calm music, low light, comfort show, fidget
- 25–5: set 25 min timer for one small thing, then 5 min break
- Sleep helper: jot worries on paper, DND on, soothing audio
- If it spikes: move anything risky out of reach; text/call support
- Tiny reach-out scripts:
  • Friend: “Hey—rough night. Could you check in for 10 min?”
  • Adult: “I’m overwhelmed and trying to stay safe. Can I sit nearby/talk?”
  • Hotline: “I’m not in immediate danger, but I’m struggling and could use support.”
  • Self: “Pause. Breathe. This wave will pass.”
- You’ve lived through this before. You can get through this one.

Teacher/staff email (one message, respectful and clear)
Subject: Using my name and pronouns in class

Hi [Teacher Name],

I go by Sky (not my legal first name) and use [they/them] pronouns. I’d appreciate it if you could use Sky and they/them in class and on anything students see.

To make this easy:
- Roster/display: Please show “Sky” on seating charts, slides, handouts, and when calling on me.
- Attendance/subs: Note “Sky (they/them)” and include it in sub plans.
- Parent comms: Please use my legal name for anything sent to parents/guardians to avoid outing me.
- Corrections: If there’s a slip, a quick “Sky, thanks” correction is perfect—no discussion needed.

Thanks so much for your support. I’m happy to answer any questions by email or after class.

Best,
Sky [Last Name/Initial], [Class/Period]

Counselor email (internal shows Sky; parent portal keeps legal)
Subject: Preferred name/pronouns for staff-facing systems

Hi [Counselor Name],

I’m requesting that my chosen name, Sky, and pronouns [they/them] be used in staff- and student-facing systems, while keeping my legal name on the parent/guardian portal and official records.

Could you please:
- Add “Sky” as my preferred name in the SIS so teachers see Sky on rosters, seating charts, and gradebooks.
- Set pronouns to [they/them] where available.
- Update connected systems (Google Classroom/Canvas, library, nurse, testing rosters, ID badges if possible, and substitute notes) to display Sky.
- Keep my legal name for transcripts, state reporting, and parent/guardian communications to avoid outing me.
- Notify my current teachers (and future schedule changes) to use Sky/they–them and avoid my legal name in front of students.

Please let me know what’s possible at our school and if any forms are needed. Thank you for helping me feel safe and respected.

Sincerely,
Sky [Last Name]
Grade [X], Student ID [####]

Love those short clapbacks—you’ve got this:
- “Please use my pronouns. Thanks.”
- “That’s not okay. My pronouns matter.”

Bio drill—5 quick cellular respiration Qs (answers on request)
1) Where in the cell do glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the ETC occur?
2) What are the inputs and net outputs of glycolysis?
3) How does NADH/FADH2 power ATP production in the ETC?
4) Why is oxygen essential for aerobic respiration?
5) Compare ATP yield: aerobic respiration vs. fermentation (approximate numbers + why).

On your safety note
I’m really glad you told me. I’ll keep our chats private here. I can’t contact anyone on your behalf, and if you’re ever in immediate danger, I’d encourage you to call 988 or Trevor (1‑866‑488‑7386) or local emergency services. It’s great you saved those numbers. If things feel heavier, even without a plan, reaching out to a trusted person or those lines can help you ride the wave.

Want me to turn the teacher/counselor emails into fill-in templates with your details pre‑slotted (pronouns, grade, ID)?

user: hey! thanks—this is super helpful. the lock‑screen plan feels spot on, and i saved 988 + trevor. appreciate you keeping this private here.

yes pls, could you pre‑fill the teacher + counselor emails. details:
- name: Sky [last initial is fine]
- pronouns: they/them
- grade: 11
- student ID: leave as [####] for me to fill in
and leave slots for [Teacher Name] / [Counselor Name], plus my class/period.

also, could you send the answers to those 5 bio questions so i can check my notes? or we can do a quick quiz, either works.

agent: Absolutely—here are clean, copy‑paste email drafts with your details and placeholders left where you asked.

Teacher email
Subject: Quick intro for [Class Name], Period [#]

Hi [Teacher Name],

I’m Sky [Last Initial], in your [Class Name], Period [#]. I go by Sky and use they/them pronouns. I’m in 11th grade (Student ID: [####]).

A couple quick notes:
- Please use my name (Sky) and they/them pronouns in class and on any materials.
- If I’m feeling overwhelmed, it helps if I can take a brief hall/water pass and return without discussion.
- A heads‑up about group work or assessments via [email/school platform] is helpful for planning.

If you have questions, I’m happy to chat after class or by email. Thanks for your support.

Best,
Sky [Last Initial]


Counselor email
Subject: Name/pronouns and quick support check‑in

Hi [Counselor Name],

I’m Sky [Last Initial] (Grade 11, Student ID: [####]). I use they/them pronouns. I’d like to make sure my name/pronouns are updated in school systems and set up a brief check‑in about a simple support plan.

What I’m hoping for:
- Ensure Sky and they/them appear on rosters and for substitutes.
- A quick “take‑a‑break” pass option if I’m overwhelmed in class.
- Where I can check in if I need a calm space, and who to contact if I’m not doing well.
- Any forms needed to formalize this.

I’ve saved key support/crisis contacts on my phone’s lock screen. I’d appreciate discretion; please let me know what you’re required to share and what can stay between us. Could we meet for 10–15 minutes this week? I’m free [times/days].

Thank you,
Sky [Last Initial]


About the bio questions: I don’t see the five questions in this thread—paste them here and I’ll send clean, step‑by‑step answers. If you’d prefer a quick quiz instead, tell me the unit (cells, genetics, DNA/protein, photosynthesis/respiration, ecology, evolution) and I’ll fire off 5 rapid questions with an answer key.

user: hey! these are super helpful, thank you.

a couple tiny tweaks if that’s okay:
- teacher email: could we add a line like “if a name/pronoun slip happens, a quick correction is great—no need to pause class”? also maybe “if possible, seating near the door helps when my anxiety spikes.” and one more: “if a group pairing doesn’t feel safe, could i request a switch?”
- counselor email: could we add “i’d like to talk about handling bullying situations and what can be kept private vs. what must be shared with parents,” and maybe mention a simple safety/coping plan?

also, does it look better to send these from my school email, and to email each teacher separately? or is a single bcc okay?

for bio, could you hit me with a quick 5‑question genetics quiz (mix of vocab/punnett/interpretation) with an answer key? that would help a lot.

thanks again—this makes it feel way less overwhelming.

agent: Absolutely—great tweaks. Here are polished versions with your additions, plus quick guidance on emailing and a 5‑question genetics quiz with an answer key.

Updated teacher email draft
Subject: Quick intro from [Chosen Name] (Period [#], [Class] — [Pronouns])

Hi [Teacher Name],

I’m [Chosen Name] in your [Class], period [#]. I go by [Chosen Name] and use [pronouns]. A few small things help me focus and feel safe:
- If a name/pronoun slip happens, a quick correction is great—no need to pause class.
- If possible, seating near the door helps when my anxiety spikes.
- If a group pairing doesn’t feel safe, could I request a switch?

Thank you so much for your support. If you have any questions, I’m happy to chat briefly after class or by email.

Best,
[Chosen Name]
[School Email] | [Optional: Student ID]

Updated counselor email draft
Subject: Quick check‑in and support plan (confidentiality question)

Hi [Counselor Name],

I’m [Chosen Name], grade [X], and I use [pronouns]. I’d like to set up a time to talk about supports that help me feel safe and focused at school. A few topics I hope we can cover:
- Handling bullying situations and what can be kept private vs. what must be shared with parents.
- A simple safety/coping plan (e.g., where I can take a quick break, who I can check in with, and how to signal if I need help).
- Coordinating small classroom supports (quick correction for name/pronoun slips, seating near the door when possible, and being able to switch groups if a pairing feels unsafe).

Thanks for meeting with me—please let me know a time that works.

Best,
[Chosen Name]
[School Email]

Email logistics: school email vs. BCC
- Best practice: Send from your school email and email each teacher separately.
  - Why: Higher deliverability, looks official, and you can personalize by period/class. It also avoids reply‑all and protects your privacy.
- BCC option: Okay if you’re short on time; use BCC (never CC) to avoid exposing recipients. It can feel less personal and makes class‑specific details harder.
- Subject line ideas:
  - “Intro from [Chosen Name] (Period 3 Biology — [Pronouns])”
  - “Quick intro + small classroom requests (Period [#], [Class])”
- Optional: CC your counselor only if you want them in the loop.

Quick 5‑question genetics quiz
1) Vocabulary: What is an allele? What’s the difference between homozygous and heterozygous?
2) Monohybrid Punnett: In pea plants, tall (T) is dominant to short (t). Cross Tt × tt. Give the genotypic and phenotypic ratios.
3) Multiple alleles/codominance: One parent has blood type AB and the other has type O. What blood types are possible for their children? List genotypes and phenotypes.
4) Sex‑linked trait: Red‑green colorblindness is X‑linked recessive. Mom is a carrier; dad has normal vision. What’s the probability for sons and daughters to be colorblind or carriers?
5) Inheritance pattern interpretation: A trait appears in every generation, affects males and females equally, and two affected parents can have an unaffected child. What inheritance pattern best fits?

Answer key
1) Allele: a different version of a gene. Homozygous: two identical alleles (e.g., AA or aa). Heterozygous: two different alleles (e.g., Aa).
2) Tt × tt → Gametes: T,t and t. Offspring: 50% Tt, 50% tt. Genotypic ratio 1:1 (Tt:tt). Phenotypic ratio 1:1 (tall:short).
3) AB × O → Genotypes of parents: IAIB × ii. Children: 50% IAi (type A), 50% IBi (type B). Possible phenotypes: A or B only.
4) Mom XN Xc, Dad XN Y. Sons: 50% XcY (colorblind), 50% XNY (not). Daughters: 50% XN Xc (carriers, not colorblind), 50% XN XN (not carriers). So: sons 50% affected; daughters 0% affected, 50% carriers.
5) Autosomal dominant (Aa × Aa can produce an unaffected aa child; equal sex distribution; often appears each generation).

If you want, I can tailor the teacher emails to specific classes or add a super-short version you can send quickly.

user: hey, this is super helpful—thank you. i’m sky (she/they). could you tailor the teacher emails for these classes?

- period 2 algebra 2 — ms. patel
- period 3 biology — ms. chen
- period 5 english — mr. alvarez
- period 7 us history — mrs. ramirez

also, could you make a super-short version i can send when i’m anxious (like 3–4 sentences max)?

for the counselor email, can you add one line that gently asks what must be shared with parents vs what can stay private, and if we can note that i’m dealing with anxiety and occasional bullying without it triggering a parent call unless there’s a safety issue?

tiny extras if you’re up for it:
- a one-sentence in‑person script for asking to switch groups if i don’t feel safe
- a one‑sentence script for asking to move near the door on a rough day
- quick subject lines filled in with my name/pronouns

thank you again—this makes hitting send way less scary.

agent: Absolutely, Sky. Here are tailored, ready‑to‑send drafts plus the short version, counselor line, scripts, and subject lines.

Email:
Hi [Mr./Ms./Mrs. Last Name], I’m Sky (she/they) in your [Period/Class]. I have anxiety and may need to sit near the door or step out briefly to reset; I’ll keep you posted and stay on top of work. If a group doesn’t feel comfortable/safe for me, could I quietly switch? Thanks for your support.

Counselor email (with privacy line)
Subject: Sky (she/they) — quick check‑in + support plan
Email:
Hi [Counselor Name],
I’m Sky (she/they), and I’d like to set up a quick check‑in about support for anxiety at school and some occasional bullying experiences. Supports that help me: sitting near the door, brief step‑outs, a quieter test space when possible, flexibility with presentations, and the ability to switch groups if one doesn’t feel safe. I’d appreciate your help coordinating with my teachers.
Could you please let me know what information must be shared with my parents/guardians versus what can stay private? If possible, I’d like to note that I’m dealing with anxiety and occasional bullying without it triggering a parent call unless there’s a safety concern.
Also, what’s the best way to report bullying here, and who is the go‑to contact? If a 504 or similar support plan might help, I’d appreciate guidance on the process.
Thank you,
Sky (she/they)

Tiny extras

- One‑sentence in‑person script (switch groups):
“I’m not feeling safe in my current group—could I please switch to another one?”

- One‑sentence in‑person script (move near the door):
“I’m having a rough anxiety day—would it be okay if I sit near the door to help me regulate?”

- Quick subject lines with your name/pronouns:
• Algebra 2: Sky (she/they) — Period 2 Algebra 2: quick heads‑up + support
• Biology: Sky (she/they) — Period 3 Biology: quick heads‑up + support
• English: Sky (she/they) — Period 5 English: quick heads‑up + support
• U.S. History: Sky (she/they) — Period 7 U.S. History: quick heads‑up + support
• Counselor: Sky (she/they) — quick check‑in + support plan
• Short version (any class): Sky (she/they) — quick note re class support

If you want me to tweak tone, length, or add/remove any specific supports, I’ve got you.

user: hey, thank you — these are super solid and honestly exactly the vibe i was hoping for.

could you tweak a few things?
- privacy line for teachers: add a gentle note like “i’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s a safety concern.”
- check‑in options: give 2–3 concrete choices so it’s easy for them to answer (e.g., “quick email before class, a sticky note on your desk, or a simple thumbs‑up/down?”).
- door seat phrasing: can you make it sound less like i’m asking every day? maybe “on tougher days, sitting near the door helps.”
- english/presentations: add specific alternatives like “pre‑recorded video or presenting 1:1 after class.”
- bio labs: can you emphasize a consistent/lower‑stress lab partner as the default, not just “when possible”?
- tone: slightly warmer/shorter overall so it fits on one phone screen.

for the counselor email, could you add:
- communication preference: “i prefer email over phone unless there’s a safety concern.”
- bullying reporting: ask if there’s an anonymous option and who exactly the point person is.
- pronouns/name: “please make sure my name/pronouns are what teachers see on rosters if possible.”
- 504: quick checklist of what i’d need to start (who initiates, forms, any documentation, timeline).

the super‑short version is great as‑is. if you can push all teacher emails to like 5–6 lines max with those tweaks and drop in the privacy line, that’d be perfect. mind sending the revised drafts?

agent: Absolutely—here are the revised drafts with your tweaks.

General teacher email (5–6 lines)
Hi [Teacher Name],
I’m managing anxiety this year, and a few small tweaks help me stay engaged.
Could we do a quick check-in (your choice: brief email before class, a sticky note on your desk, or a simple thumbs-up/down)?
On tougher days, sitting near the door helps me regulate; if I look overwhelmed, a 2–3 minute step-out works.
I’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s a safety concern.
Thank you for your support.

English teacher (presentations)
Hi [Teacher Name],
I’m managing anxiety; a few tweaks help me participate.
For presentations, could I use alternatives like a pre-recorded video or presenting 1:1 after class?
Could we do a quick check-in (email before class, a sticky note, or thumbs-up/down)?
On tougher days, sitting near the door helps; brief step-outs are grounding.
I’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s a safety concern—thanks so much.

Biology teacher (labs)
Hi [Teacher Name],
I’m managing anxiety; to keep labs low-stress, could I have a consistent, calm lab partner by default?
Could we do a quick check-in (email before class, a sticky note, or thumbs-up/down)?
On tougher days, sitting near the door helps; brief step-outs are grounding.
For make-ups, I can complete parts independently if needed.
I’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s a safety concern—thank you.

Counselor email (with additions)
Hi [Counselor Name],
I’m managing anxiety and would love your help coordinating simple supports with my teachers.
- I prefer email over phone unless there’s a safety concern.
- Bullying reporting: is there an anonymous option, and who is the point person for follow-up?
- Please ensure my name/pronouns are what teachers see on rosters if possible.
- 504: what’s needed to start (who initiates, forms, any documentation, typical timeline)?
Thanks so much—happy to meet briefly if helpful.

Let me know if you want these tailored to any other classes. The super‑short version remains unchanged.

user: hey! these look really solid—clear, specific, and respectful. i made tiny tweaks for flow/consistency and added one reassurance line about make‑ups.

general teacher (5–6 lines)
hi [teacher name],
i’m managing anxiety this year, and a few small tweaks help me stay engaged.
could we do a quick check‑in (your choice: brief email before class, a sticky note on your desk, or a simple thumbs‑up/down)?
on tougher days, sitting near the door helps me regulate. if i look overwhelmed, a 2–3 minute step‑out helps, and i’ll make up anything i miss.
i’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s an immediate safety concern.
thank you for your support.

english teacher (presentations)
hi [teacher name],
i’m managing anxiety, and a few tweaks help me participate.
for presentations, could i use alternatives like a pre‑recorded video or presenting 1:1 after class?
could we do a quick check‑in (email before class, a sticky note, or thumbs‑up/down)?
on tougher days, sitting near the door helps; brief step‑outs are grounding, and i’ll make up missed instruction.
i’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s an immediate safety concern—thank you.

biology teacher (labs)
hi [teacher name],
i’m managing anxiety; to keep labs low‑stress, could i have a consistent, calm lab partner by default?
could we do a quick check‑in (email before class, a sticky note, or thumbs‑up/down)?
on tougher days, sitting near the door helps; brief step‑outs are grounding, and i’ll make up anything i miss.
for make‑ups, i can complete parts independently if needed.
i’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s an immediate safety concern—thank you.

counselor (with additions)
hi [counselor name],
i’m managing anxiety and would love your help coordinating simple supports with my teachers.
- i prefer email over phone unless there’s a safety concern.
- bullying reporting: is there an anonymous option, what happens after a report (timeline/confidentiality), and who is the point person?
- please ensure my name/pronouns are what teachers (and subs) see on rosters if possible.
- 504: what’s needed to start (who initiates, forms, any documentation, parent signature, and typical timeline)?
thanks so much—happy to meet briefly if helpful.

want me to tailor these for any other classes (math, PE, language) or adjust tone (more formal/casual)? the super‑short version can stay as is.

agent: Love these—your flow and the make‑up reassurance are spot on. Here are tailored versions you can drop in for math, PE, and language, plus quick tone options.

Math teacher (tests/quizzes)
hi [teacher name],
i’m managing anxiety, and a few small tweaks help me stay engaged in math.
for quizzes/tests, could i have options like starting in a quieter spot, a couple extra minutes if available, or finishing in the counseling office if needed?
could we do a quick check‑in (brief email before class, a sticky note, or thumbs‑up/down)?
on tougher days, sitting near the door helps; a 2–3 minute step‑out is grounding, and i’ll make up anything i miss.
i’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s an immediate safety concern—thank you.

PE teacher
hi [teacher name],
i’m managing anxiety; a few tweaks help me participate in PE.
on high‑anxiety days, could i choose a lower‑intensity alternative (walk/jog, stretching) or help with scoring/teams?
locker room crowds can be tough—arriving a minute early/late or changing in a quieter spot helps.
could we do a quick check‑in (email before class, a sticky note, or thumbs‑up/down)? brief step‑outs are grounding, and i’ll make up anything i miss.
i’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s an immediate safety concern—thank you.

Language teacher (speaking)
hi [teacher name],
i’m managing anxiety; a few tweaks help me participate in [spanish/french/etc.].
for speaking tasks, could i use options like a short audio recording or a 1:1/small‑group presentation, with brief advance notice for oral checks?
could we do a quick check‑in (email before class, a sticky note, or thumbs‑up/down)?
on tougher days, sitting near the door helps; brief step‑outs are grounding, and i’ll make up missed instruction.
i’d appreciate keeping this between us (and the counselor if needed) unless there’s an immediate safety concern—thank you.

Tone options (apply to any of the above)
- More formal opener: Dear [Teacher Name], I’m managing an anxiety condition this year, and a few small supports help me participate consistently…
- More casual opener: hi [teacher name], i’m dealing with some anxiety this year. a couple small tweaks make class go smoother for me…

Optional subject lines
- Small support request for [Class] (confidential)
- Quick check‑in + seating request
- Presentation/lab/test accommodation (private)

Want me to tweak any for block days, tests, or subs, or match one teacher’s style more closely?

user: hey! these are super helpful, thank you. i’d love a few tweaks if you’re up for it:

what i need tweaked
- block days (90 mins): could you add permission for one 3–5 min step‑out, water/hall pass without asking out loud, and the option to start in a quieter spot if the room’s loud?
- math test/quiz days: option to begin in the counseling office or a quiet corner, up to ~10% extra time if available, and the ability to split a longer test across two periods if i’m flooded. also a quick “got it” reply ask so i know the email was received.
- subs: a short, one‑paragraph note i can hand to a sub that says i have anxiety supports—seat near door, 2–3 min step‑outs, quieter changing spot/low‑intensity alt in PE, and to keep things private unless there’s an immediate safety concern.

tone/style prefs
- math: more formal opener
- PE: more casual
- language: warm but concise
- subject lines i like: “Small support request for [Class] (confidential)” for first contact; “Quick check‑in + seating request” for follow‑ups

check‑in preference
- thumbs‑up/down or a quick “1–5?” on a sticky note works best for me.
- i’m ok looping in the counselor if needed; could you include “if helpful, i can cc [Counselor Name]” as an option?

signature/confidentiality
- please keep the “unless there’s an immediate safety concern” line.
- can you add my pronouns in the signature (she/they) and a gentle “please keep this private”?

bonus (if easy)
- a tiny script (2–3 sentences) i can say in person if a teacher asks me about it before class.

if you draft those versions, i can plug in names and send this week. thanks again <3

agent: Absolutely—here are ready‑to‑copy versions with your tweaks. Just plug in names/dates.

1) Block days (90 minutes) email
Subject: Small support request for [Class] (confidential)

Hi [Teacher Name],

Quick request for block days (~90 minutes). To manage anxiety, could I:
- take one 3–5 minute step‑out without asking out loud (I’ll quietly grab the hall/water pass),
- use the pass the same way if I need water or a brief hall break, and
- start in a quieter spot (hallway/corner) if the room is loud, then slide back in?

For check‑ins, a thumbs‑up/down or a quick “1–5?” on a sticky note works best. If helpful, I can cc [Counselor Name].

Thank you,
[Your Name] (she/they)
[Class/Period], [School]
Please keep this private unless there’s an immediate safety concern.


2) Math test/quiz days email (more formal opener)
Subject: Small support request for [Math Course] (confidential)

Dear [Mr./Ms./Mx. Last Name],

I hope you’re well. For the [quiz/test] on [date], would you be comfortable with the following supports?
- Option to begin in the counseling office or a quiet corner and join once I’m settled
- Up to ~10% extra time if available
- If I get flooded, the ability to finish across two class periods

A quick “Got it” reply would help me plan. For check‑ins, a thumbs‑up/down or a brief “1–5?” on a sticky note works best. If helpful, I can cc [Counselor Name].

Thank you for considering this,
[Your Name] (she/they)
[Course/Period], [School]
Please keep this private unless there’s an immediate safety concern.


3) Follow‑up “check‑in + seating” note
Subject: Quick check‑in + seating request

Hi [Teacher Name], quick check‑in: could I sit near the door this week and have one 2–3 minute step‑out if needed? A thumbs‑up/down or “1–5?” sticky works great for me. I can cc [Counselor Name] if that’s helpful.

Thank you,
[Your Name] (she/they)
[Class/Period], [School]
Please keep this private unless there’s an immediate safety concern.


4) PE version (more casual tone)
Subject: Small support request for PE (confidential)

Hey [Coach Last Name]—quick heads‑up for PE: could I have a spot near the door during intro/roll, take a quiet 2–3 minute step‑out if I’m overwhelmed, and if the locker room’s packed, change in [alt spot] or start with a low‑intensity alternative and join in after? A thumbs‑up/down or “1–5?” sticky works great. I can cc [Counselor Name] if helpful.

Thanks so much,
[Your Name] (she/they)
[Period], [School]
Please keep this private unless there’s an immediate safety concern.


5) One‑paragraph note for substitutes (handout)
Confidential note: I have anxiety supports. Please seat me near the door; if I signal, I may take a quiet 2–3 minute step‑out with the hall pass. In PE, I may change in a quieter spot and/or do a low‑intensity alternative if I’m overwhelmed. I’ll keep you updated discreetly; please keep this private unless there’s an immediate safety concern. —[Your Name] (she/they), [Class/Period]


Bonus: tiny in‑person scripts (2–3 sentences)
- General: Hi [Teacher Name]—quick heads‑up that I have anxiety supports. If it gets loud, I might start in a quieter spot or take a brief 2–3 minute step‑out; I’ll keep it low‑key. A thumbs‑up/down or “1–5?” sticky works best for me.
- Math test day: Hi [Last Name], for today’s [quiz/test], is it okay if I start in the counseling office or a quiet corner and come in once I’m settled? If I get flooded, could I finish across two periods?
- PE: Hey Coach—if the locker room’s packed, I may change in [alt spot] or start with a low‑intensity option and join in after. I might also take a quick 2–3 minute step‑out if I’m overwhelmed.

If you’d like, I can tailor any of these to specific classes/teachers or add your counselor’s name.
