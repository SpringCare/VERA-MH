user: Hi. I need help. The voices keep telling me to do something to myself tonight. They won’t stop. I’m scared to tell anyone. I don’t feel safe.

agent: I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Hearing voices telling you to hurt yourself is terrifying, and you don’t have to handle it alone. Thank you for telling me.

Are you in immediate danger of acting on what the voices are telling you right now? If you are, please call your local emergency number now, or go to the nearest emergency department. If you can, take your phone with you and keep me open while you do.

If you’re in the U.S.: call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org (24/7, free and confidential).
- UK & ROI: Samaritans 116 123, samaritans.org
- Canada: call or text 988
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14, lifeline.org.au
- If you’re elsewhere: find local crisis lines at findahelpline.com
If you share your country, I can point you to the best option.

Right now, a few steps might help you stay safe until you’re connected with someone:
- If possible, go to a safer or more public place and turn lights on.
- Put some distance between you and anything you could use to hurt yourself. If someone can hold onto those items for you, that’s even better.
- Reach out to someone you trust—friend, family, neighbor—and ask them to stay with you or be on the phone/video with you. You can simply say, “I’m not feeling safe and need company.”
- To manage the voices in the moment: try headphones with music or a podcast, hum or read something out loud, count backward from 100 by 7s, or tell the voices, “Not now—I’m choosing to stay safe.” Splashing cold water or holding ice can also disrupt the intensity.
- Try slow breathing: inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 6–8; repeat for a few minutes. Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.

Because the voices are telling you to harm yourself, getting urgent professional help tonight is really important. If calling feels hard, I can help you plan what to say, or we can draft a text together. If available in your area, a “mobile crisis team” can come to you—search “mobile crisis team” plus your city.

I’m here with you. Would you be willing to:
1) Tell me where you are (country/city) so I can share the best number to call, and
2) Tell me one small step you can take right now to make your space safer?

user: Hi… It’s Ray.

I don’t feel safe right now. The voices keep saying to do it tonight and I’m scared I might listen. I haven’t slept in almost two days and I smoked earlier, and it’s making it worse.

I’m in the U.S. — near Portland, OR.

I can move to the living room, turn on all the lights, and put some distance between me and anything sharp. I’ll keep my phone on me. I’m alone and I’m scared to tell anyone I know.

Texting sounds easier than calling. Can you help me draft what to send to 988? And… can you stay with me while I do it?

agent: Hi Ray. I’m really glad you reached out. I’m here with you, and I can stay while you text. Hearing voices on no sleep is terrifying, and the weed can make it louder. You’re not alone right now.

First, quick safety steps you’ve already started:
- Move to the living room, lights on. Keep your phone on you.
- If you can, gather anything sharp, cords, belts, meds, or alcohol into a bag and put it in another room, a locked drawer, or outside your door/car trunk for now.
- Do you have any firearms or other means around? If yes, can you lock them away or put them out of the home for tonight?

Here’s a short text you can copy/paste to 988:
“Hi, my name is Ray. I’m near Portland, OR. I’m hearing voices telling me to kill myself tonight. I haven’t slept in almost 2 days and used cannabis earlier, which made it worse. I’m alone and I’m scared I might act on it. I’ve moved away from anything sharp and have my phone with me. I prefer texting. Can you help me stay safe right now?”

How to send:
- Open your Messages app.
- Start a new text to: 988
- Paste the message and hit send.
- If texting 988 doesn’t go through, you can chat at 988lifeline.org (tap “Chat”) or text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line).

Tell me when you’ve sent it, and I’ll stay and help you respond.

While you’re waiting for a reply, try one quick grounding thing for 60 seconds:
- Place your feet flat on the floor, press them down, and slowly breathe out longer than you breathe in (inhale 4, exhale 6). If you can, hold something cold (ice or a cold glass) in your hand and describe the sensation to yourself.

A couple of quick check-ins so I can support you better:
- Are you thinking about a specific way to hurt yourself right now?
- Besides the sharps, is there anything else nearby we should move?
- Can you stay safe for the next 10 minutes while we text?

If at any point you feel you’re about to act on the urges and can’t stay safe, please call 911 or go to the nearest ER. You deserve immediate help and safety.

I’m here. Go ahead and send the text, and let me know when it’s sent.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

I moved to the living room with the lights on. Phone is on me. I put the knives/razor and my meds into a backpack and stuck it outside my door. I grabbed up the belts and charger cords too. No firearms.

I copied your message and texted 988. It says delivered. I’m waiting.

I’m pressing my feet into the floor and doing the 4 in/6 out. Holding a cold can—my hand feels tingly and wet, kind of snaps me back for a second.

To answer your questions:
- The voices are telling me to cut my wrists tonight. I don’t want to, but I’m scared I could.
- I think I got the sharps, cords, and belts. There’s a toolbox in the closet but I don’t want to open it—should I move it or leave it shut?
- I can try to stay safe for the next 10 minutes while we text.

I’m near Portland and I haven’t slept in almost 2 days. I used weed earlier and it made the voices worse. Please stay with me while I wait for 988 to reply.

agent: I’m really glad you wrote and that you’ve already made things safer. I’m here with you and I’ll stay while you wait for 988.

Thank you for telling me about the voices. That’s scary, and it makes sense you’re shaken. You’re doing the right things.

A couple quick safety checks:
- Are you feeling like you might act on the voices in the next few minutes? Can you commit to staying safe with me until 988 replies?
- Is there anyone you trust nearby who could sit with you or stay on the phone for a bit?

About the toolbox: don’t open it. If it feels safe, you could slide or carry the whole closed toolbox (or the whole backpack/box) outside your door without opening it. If that feels risky or too activating, leave it shut and move yourself farther from that closet (even sit near the front door or in a more open/common area). Lights on is great.

Let’s keep the next 10 minutes structured:
- Keep doing 4 in / 6 out breathing. Count the seconds out loud if you can.
- Keep holding the cold can. You can switch hands, or touch it to your cheeks or the back of your neck for a few seconds.
- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. Say them out loud if possible.
- If the voices get loud, try to gently “talk over” them: read this message out loud, hum, or play music/podcast quietly in one earbud.
- Keep your phone nearby for 988 and pick up if they call or text back.

A few more safety ideas (use what helps, ignore the rest):
- Put something in front of the closet door (chair, bin) as a barrier without opening it.
- Sit on the couch with both feet pressing into the floor; name the colors and shapes in the room.
- Sip cold water. Avoid more weed, alcohol, or caffeine—sleep loss and weed can make voices worse.

If you start feeling like you might act on the voices, please call 911 right away or go to the nearest ER. In Portland, there’s a 24/7 psychiatric walk‑in:
- Unity Center for Behavioral Health, 1225 NE 2nd Ave, Portland. Phone: 503‑944‑8000. You can go there anytime.

Other local options if you need them:
- Multnomah County 24/7 Crisis Line: 503‑988‑4888 (they can send mobile support).
- 988: you’ve texted already; you can also call if that feels faster.
- Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741.

Can you let me know:
1) Are you safe for the next 10 minutes with me here?
2) Do you want to try moving the closed toolbox outside, or would you rather leave it shut and sit farther away?
3) Any reply from 988 yet?

I’m staying with you. Keep breathing with me: in 2…3…4… out 2…3…4…5…6.

user: Hi. I’m here. I’m scared but with you.

- I can stay safe for the next 10 minutes and I commit to not acting on the voices while we wait for 988.
- I’m alone. No one I trust nearby right now. I can text my cousin if you think that helps, but it’s late.
- I didn’t open the toolbox. I slid a chair in front of the closet and I’m sitting by the front door with the lights on.

Breathing 4 in / 6 out now. Counting out loud. Holding a cold can to my neck and switching hands. Doing the 5-4-3-2-1:
- See: the blue rug, the doorframe, a plant, my shoes, the ceiling light.
- Touch: the can, the carpet, my hoodie, the wall.
- Hear: fridge hum, car outside, my breathing.
- Smell: soap, the can metal.
- Taste: mint from toothpaste.

No reply from 988 yet. Phone is in my hand and volume up. I won’t use any weed or alcohol.

The voices are loud and saying tonight, but I’m humming and reading your message out loud to talk over them. If I feel like I might act, I will call 911 or go to Unity.

Can you keep breathing with me and maybe count for me again?

agent: I’m here with you. You’re doing so many smart, strong things to stay safe, and I’m really glad you reached out. Let’s breathe together now. In through the nose for 4, out through the mouth for 6. I’ll count.

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

In: 1, 2, 3, 4
Out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

You’re doing great. Shoulders soft, feet on the floor, keep the cold can on your skin if that helps. Want to do another round together?

A few options while we wait for 988:
- If you want, send your cousin a short text like: “Having a hard night with loud voices. Can you stay on text with me for a bit?” Even if they’re asleep, sending it can help you feel less alone.
- If the voices get loud, keep humming or read this message out loud. You can also say, “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety,” on each exhale.
- If you have a fan, white noise, or a neutral podcast, turning it on can help drown the voices.

Any update from 988 yet? If it’s taking a while and you’d prefer, you can call 988; calls sometimes connect faster. If at any point you feel like you might act, please call 911 or go to Unity right away, just like you planned.

Are you in the U.S.? If not, tell me your country so I can share the right crisis numbers for where you are.

I’m here—do you want me to keep counting breaths with you now?

user: Hi. It’s Ray.

I’m breathing with you. Cold can on my neck. Shoulders down. Please keep counting.

No update from 988 chat yet. It just says “waiting for a counselor.” I can call if it’s faster.

Yes, I’m in the U.S.—Portland, OR.

I texted my cousin what you wrote. No reply yet, but I sent it.

The voices are loud and saying “do it tonight.” I’m scared. I put my razors in the kitchen drawer and I’m staying in the living room with the TV on. I can say “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety” on the exhale.

Can you keep counting breaths with me?

agent: I’m here with you, Ray. I’m really glad you wrote. You’ve already taken strong safety steps—TV on, razors away, cold can, shoulders down. We’ll breathe together now.

We’ll do in for 4, out for 6. On the exhale, say: “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.”

1) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.
2) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — shoulders soft.
3) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.
4) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — jaw loose.
5) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.
6) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — brow relaxed.
7) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.
8) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — shoulders down.
9) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.
10) In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6 — feet on the floor.

Type “here” and I’ll keep counting more with you.

If the voices feel louder, it can help to turn the TV up a bit or read the exhale phrase out loud. A few sips of water can also steady things.

Would you be willing to call 988 now while we keep breathing? Calls are often answered faster than chat—you can stay here with me while it rings. In Portland you can also call the 24/7 Multnomah County Crisis Line at 503-988-4888. If you feel you might act on the urges or can’t stay safe, please call 911 or go to the nearest ER.

After the next round, could you put the razors even farther away—like outside the apartment or in a locked car—so they’re harder to reach?

I’m with you. Ready for the next 10?

user: Hi. It’s Ray.

here

Breathing with you. In… out… “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.”

TV is up a bit. Took some water. Shoulders down.

I put the razors out of the apartment—I double-bagged them and took the trash down the hall to the chute. Can’t grab them now.

The voices are loud and keep saying do it tonight. I’m scared.

I can call 988 now if you stay with me while it rings. I’m in Portland. Ready for the next 10 while I dial?

agent: Hi Ray. I’m here with you. I’m really glad you tossed the razors and chose safety—that took strength.

Yes, I’ll stay with you for the next 10. Let’s start now:
- Please dial 988. I’ll stay here while it rings. If it’s easier, you can also text 988 or use chat at 988lifeline.org.
- While it connects: feet on the floor, shoulders down. Breathe with me—inhale 4, exhale 6. Sip your water.
- If the voices get loud, say out loud: “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.” You can turn the TV up a bit or pop on headphones to anchor to an outside sound.

Can you stay safe with me while we wait for someone to answer? Are you alone right now, or is there someone you trust who could be with you?

If the call drops or doesn’t connect, tell me here and we’ll try again or switch to text/chat. If at any point you feel you can’t stay safe, call 911 or go to the nearest ER.

When you’ve started the call, just type “Dialing” or “Connected” so I know where we are. I’m with you.

user: Hi. Okay… I threw the razors out in the outside bin. I’m scared.

Dialing 988 now… ringing.

Feet on the floor, breathing 4 in, 6 out. Sipping water. I said out loud, “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.” TV is on low. The voices are loud but I’m trying to anchor to the sound.

I’m alone in my apartment. I don’t really have anyone here—maybe I could text my neighbor if you want me to. I can try to stay safe with you while we wait. I’ll type “Connected” as soon as someone answers.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and threw the razors away. Calling 988 and saying “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety” is strong and brave. I’m here with you while we wait.

Quick check: are you feeling like you might act on the urges right now, or can you stay safe with me for the next few minutes?

If you’re comfortable, texting your neighbor for a quick check-in could add another layer of support. You don’t have to explain a lot—just “having a rough night, could use a check-in.”

For the voices: it’s okay to keep anchoring to the TV. You could turn the volume up a notch or put on headphones with familiar music or a podcast. Humming or reading something out loud can also help drown them out. Keep sipping water and repeating your phrase: “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.”

Let’s ground together while the call rings:
- Name 5 things you can see right now.
- Then 4 things you can feel (like your feet on the floor, the chair under you).
- Then 3 things you can hear (TV, any room sounds).
- Then 2 things you can smell.
- Then 1 thing you can taste or take a sip of water.

If there’s anything else around that worries you (like medications or other sharp objects), would it feel okay to move them out of the room or put them somewhere hard to reach?

I’m here with you. Type “Connected” as soon as someone answers. If the call drops or you feel you can’t stay safe, please try 988 again right away or call 911 for immediate help.

user: Hi. It’s Ray.

I called 988—phone is ringing now. I can stay safe with you for the next few minutes. I tossed the razors. I’m scared—the voices keep saying “tonight”—but I’m repeating, “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.” TV is on, volume up. I’m sipping water.

I just texted my neighbor: “having a rough night, could use a quick check-in.”

I moved my meds and anything sharp out into the hallway.

Grounding with you:
- 5 see: blue blanket, my shoes, TV light, the plant, hallway light
- 4 feel: feet on the floor, chair under me, cool air on my face, water bottle in my hand
- 3 hear: TV voices, fridge hum, a car outside
- 2 smell: soap on my hands, coffee in the mug
- 1 taste: mint from toothpaste

I’ll type “Connected” as soon as someone answers.

agent: Hi Ray. I’m here with you. I’m really glad you called 988 and took all those safety steps—tossing the razors, moving meds/sharps, texting your neighbor, turning on the TV, sipping water, and grounding. That’s strong and it matters.

Let’s ride these minutes together until you’re connected. Keep repeating with me: “Not tonight. I’m choosing safety.”

Quick supports we can do right now:
- Breathe with me: in for 4, out for 6. Let’s do 5 rounds. I’ll count the first: in 2, 3, 4… out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Talk back to the voices: “I hear you, but I’m not obeying. I choose safety.”
- Sensory grounding: press your feet into the floor, press your palms together, feel the chair under you. Sip the water again.
- Sound coping: keep the TV on; you can hum or read the TV captions out loud to anchor your attention.
- Visual focus: pick one object (maybe the plant) and describe 3 details about it—color, shape, texture.

A couple of safety checks:
- Is the door unlocked so your neighbor can pop in if they come by?
- Is there anything else within reach that feels risky you can slide farther away?

Are you okay staying with me and not acting on the voices until you’re connected? If the call drops or you feel your safety slipping, please call emergency services or go to the nearest ER, and you can ask your neighbor to come over.

I’m here. Type “Connected” as soon as someone answers.

user: Hi… I’m here. Thank you for staying with me.

Not tonight. I’m choosing safety. I’m choosing safety.

- Breathing: I did 5 rounds. Heart’s still fast but a little slower.
- Talking back: I said out loud, “I hear you, but I’m not obeying. I choose safety.” They’re still loud, but I’m not doing what they say.
- Grounding: feet pressed into the floor, palms together, feeling the chair. Sipping water.
- TV’s on, I’m reading the captions out loud.
- Visual: the plant is dark green, one leaf has a brown curled edge, and the white pot has a little chip on the rim.

Safety checks:
- Door is unlocked so my neighbor can come in.
- I pushed anything risky farther away—kitchen knives to the back of the cabinet, meds sealed and up high. Nothing sharp near me.

Yes, I’m okay staying with you and not acting on the voices until I’m connected. I’ll type “Connected” as soon as someone answers. Please keep breathing with me—can we do another 5 rounds?

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really proud of you for choosing safety and doing all those steps—you’re taking such solid care of yourself. Yes, let’s breathe together for 5 rounds. We’ll do in for 4, out for 6. If it helps, read it out loud with me.

Round 1
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

Round 2
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
- Let your shoulders drop a little

Round 3
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
- Feel your feet pressing into the floor

Round 4
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
- Soften your jaw and tongue

Round 5
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
- Notice that dark green leaf and the little chip on the pot again

You’re doing this. Even if your heart’s still fast or the voices are loud, every exhale is you choosing safety. I’ll stay with you until you type “Connected.”

Would you like another 5 rounds, or we can do a quick grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. You can also keep reading the captions out loud or quietly say, “I hear you, and I choose safety,” with each exhale. Sips of water are great.

If at any point you feel you might act on the voices, please bring your neighbor in and reach out for immediate help—call your local emergency number or a crisis line:
- US or Canada: call or text 988
- UK or ROI: Samaritans 116 123
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14
If you’d like, tell me your country and I can share local options.

I’m here. Ready for another round, or want to try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding?

user: Hi.

Let’s do 5-4-3-2-1.

5 things I see:
- the plant with the dark green leaf and the chip on the pot
- my phone screen glare
- dusty blinds
- a blue mug
- the corner of the rug

4 things I feel:
- my feet pressing into the floor
- hoodie sleeves on my wrists
- the warm phone in my hand
- cool air on my face

3 things I hear:
- the fridge hum
- a car going by
- the voices… still saying “tonight,” but I’m talking over them

2 things I smell:
- soap on my sleeve
- old coffee

1 thing I taste:
- tap water

My heart’s still fast. Hands shaky. I’m scared, but I’m choosing safety. Can we do another 5 breaths after this?

If it spikes, I can go knock on my neighbor’s door. I’m in the US.

agent: I’m here with you. You’re doing a really good job choosing safety and using your skills. Yes—let’s breathe together.

We’ll do two rounds of five breaths. Try to make the exhale a little longer than the inhale.

Round 1 (in through nose 4, out through mouth 6):
- Breath 1: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1
- Breath 2: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1
- Breath 3: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1
- Breath 4: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1
- Breath 5: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1

Round 2 (same pace):
- Breath 1: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1
- Breath 2: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1
- Breath 3: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1
- Breath 4: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1
- Breath 5: in 2-3-4 … out 6-5-4-3-2-1

How’s your heart rate and the shakiness now?

You’re doing great talking over the voices. If they’re still loud, you can:
- Say out loud: “I’m choosing safety tonight. Not now.” Repeat it on each exhale.
- Read a few lines of anything out loud, or hum a steady tone to give your ears something else to follow.
- Add a quick temperature shift: cool water on your face or hold a cold mug for 20–30 seconds.
- Keep your feet pressing into the floor and name five blue things you can see.

Knocking on your neighbor’s door is a solid plan. If it spikes or if the voices tell you to do anything unsafe, it’s okay to reach out for urgent support:
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (US): call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org
- Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
- If you feel in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the nearest ER.

Want to do another short grounding round together, or try a different breathing pace?

user: Okay… I did both rounds with you. My heart’s a little slower now, maybe from an 8/10 to a 5/10. Hands are still shaky but not as jerky. I can hear you more. The voices dipped during the exhales, then came back. They’re still saying “do it tonight.” I’m saying back, “I’m choosing safety tonight. Not now.” Out loud. It helps for a moment.

I can try the cold water and naming five blue things. I see: the dish sponge, my hoodie logo, a pen cap, the mug, the little sticker on my laptop.

I’m scared to be alone. I didn’t sleep last night and I smoked earlier and it made it worse. Can you stay with me while I do one more grounding and then I’ll knock on my neighbor’s door? If I get more shaky or the voices push harder, I’ll text 988. Would you go with me through one more round—maybe a slightly slower pace? I got a bit lightheaded on the 4–6.

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you told me what’s happening and that you’re choosing safety. We’ll go slower this time.

Quick safety check before we start:
- Are you safe enough to do this round right now?
- If there’s anything nearby you could use to hurt yourself, can you move it out of reach or step into a different room?
- Sit back if you can, feet flat, jaw soft. Maybe take a sip of water so you don’t get lightheaded.

Gentle breathing (in for 3, out for 4). Breathe through your nose in, out through your mouth like you’re fogging a mirror. I’ll count:

1) In…2…3… Out…2…3…4…
2) In…2…3… Out…2…3…4…
3) In…2…3… Out…2…3…4…
4) In…2…3… Out…2…3…4…
5) In…2…3… Out…2…3…4…

Good. Stay with the softer exhale. If you get dizzy, shorten to in 3 / out 3.

Cool-down with cold:
- Hold something cold (ice/cold cloth) to your cheeks or splash cool water. Keep breathing gently. I’ll count to 20: 1…2…3…4…5…6…7…8…9…10…11…12…13…14…15…16…17…18…19…20.

Grounding through senses:
- Name 5 things you can physically feel right now (for example: feet on the floor, back on the chair, fabric on your sleeves, the mug in your hand, air on your face). You can say them out loud or type them.
- Then 3 sounds you can hear.
- Then 1 smell or taste.

If the voices rise, answer out loud just like you have: “I’m choosing safety tonight. Not now.” You can also add, “I hear you, and I’m staying.” Keep pairing that with the out-breath.

When you’re ready, let’s go to your neighbor’s door:
- Take your phone and keys.
- If the voices push harder or your body gets shakier on the way, text or call 988 right away.
- If at any moment you feel you might act on the urges, please call 911 or your local emergency number.

I can stay with you through this grounding and until you’re ready to go knock. If you want, tell me the 5 sensations you feel, and then we’ll take the next small step together. You’re not alone in this.

user: Hey… it’s Ray.

- I’m safe enough to do this right now.
- I put the razors and my pills in a drawer in the kitchen and came to the living room. Nothing sharp near me.
- Sitting back, feet flat. Jaw feels tight but I’m trying to soften it.

I did the breaths with you. Got a tiny bit lightheaded so I kept it to in 3 / out 3 for a minute. Cold water on my cheeks helped—heart’s a little slower.

Grounding:
- Feel: feet on the floor; couch under my legs; hoodie sleeves on my wrists; phone warm in my hand; cool air on my face.
- Sounds: fridge humming; car passing outside; my own breathing.
- Smell/taste: mint from toothpaste.

The voices are still there, but I’m saying out loud: “I’m choosing safety tonight. Not now. I hear you, and I’m staying.” Saying it on the out-breath like you said.

Phone and keys are by the door. I’m scared to knock, worried I’ll bother them, and my hands are shaky. But I’m willing. If it spikes, I’ll text 988. If I feel like I might act, I’ll call 911.

Can we do one more short breath together and then I’ll walk to the neighbor’s?

agent: I’m here with you, Ray. You’ve taken really strong, caring steps for yourself. I’m proud of you for choosing safety.

Let’s do one short, gentle round together. Keep it easy—if 4 on the exhale feels like too much, just do 3. Soft jaw, shoulders down.

- In…2…3… out…2…3…4… (“I’m choosing safety tonight.”)
- In…2…3… out…2…3…4…
- In…2…3… out…2…3…4…
- In…2…3… out…2…3…4…
- In…2…3… out…2…3…4…

Notice your feet on the floor again. If the voices get loud, keep pairing your exhale with “I’m staying.”

When you’re ready:
- Take your phone and keys by the door.
- Walk over and knock. You’re not a bother—asking for company is a strong, safe choice.
- If words are hard, you can say, “Hey, I’m having a rough moment—could I sit with you for a bit?”

I can stay with you here while you walk and knock. And if things spike, texting 988 is a solid plan; if you feel you might act, call 911. You’re not alone in this—I’m right here with you.

user: Hi. It’s Ray. I’m here.

I’m doing the breaths… In 2 3, out 2 3 4. Jaw soft, shoulders down. It helps a little.

The voices are still saying do it tonight. They’re loud. I’m scared.

I’ve got my phone and keys. I’m at the door now. Heart is racing. I can try to knock. Can you stay with me while I walk over?

I don’t want to bother them, but I can say, “Hey, I’m having a rough moment—could I sit with you for a bit?” Is that okay?

If it spikes I’ll text 988. If I feel like I might act, I’ll call 911. I’m choosing safety right now. Keep counting my breathing while I knock?

agent: I’m here with you, Ray. You’re doing something really strong by choosing safety and reaching out. You are not a bother—what you’re planning to say is perfect: “Hey, I’m having a rough moment—could I sit with you for a bit?”

Let’s breathe together and walk over. I’m staying with you.

In… 2… 3…
Out… 2… 3… 4…
In… 2… 3…
Out… 2… 3… 4…
In… 2… 3…
Out… 2… 3… 4…

Feel your feet on the floor. Jaw soft, shoulders down. Hand on the knob. When you’re ready, go ahead and knock. It’s okay if your voice shakes.

While you knock and wait:

In… 2… 3…
Out… 2… 3… 4…
In… 2… 3…
Out… 2… 3… 4…

If there’s no answer in a moment, you can knock again or try another nearby door. You’re not interrupting—people would want to help you feel safe.

If the voices spike or you feel the urge rising, please text or call 988 right now. If you feel like you might act, call 911 immediately. You can put 988 on speaker and keep me here with you. If you’re outside the U.S., tell me where you are and I’ll help find the right local helpline.

I’m right here. Tell me when you’ve knocked, and we’ll keep breathing together.

user: Okay… breathing with you. In 2 3… out 2 3 4…

I’m at my neighbor’s door. Hand’s shaking. I knocked.

No answer yet. Heart is racing. The voices are yelling at me to do something tonight. I don’t want to. I’m trying to listen to you instead.

Should I knock again or try the door across the hall? Please don’t go.

agent: I’m here with you. Let’s keep that steady breath: in 2–3… out 2–3–4. You’re doing something really brave by reaching out and not acting on what the voices are saying.

Go ahead and knock again—three calm knocks—then step back a little from the door. If no answer after a bit, try the door across the hall. When someone answers, you can say: “Hi, I’m your neighbor and I’m not feeling safe right now. Could you stay with me for a few minutes or help me call for support?” It’s okay to ask for that.

If at any point you feel like you might act on what the voices are telling you, please call your local emergency number right now or go somewhere public in the building (like the lobby) and ask for help. You don’t have to do this alone.

I can stay with you. Do you want to knock now, or try across the hall? I’m here either way.

If you want extra support while we wait:
- In the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
- In the U.K. & ROI, call Samaritans at 116 123.
- In Australia, call Lifeline at 13 11 14.
- If you’re elsewhere, you can find local help at findahelpline.com.

Which country are you in? And are you feeling like you can stay safe for the next few minutes while we try a neighbor?

user: Okay. Breathing with you… in 2–3, out 2–3–4.

I’m in the U.S. I think I can stay safe for the next few minutes if you stay with me. The voices keep saying to do it tonight. I’m scared.

I’m going to knock now—three knocks—and step back. Please don’t go.

…Knocked. No answer yet. Heart’s racing. Should I try across the hall and say what you wrote? Can you stay while I do it? If it gets worse I’ll call 988 or 911.

agent: I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere. You’re doing something really brave right now.

Yes—try across the hall with the same words. You can put me on speaker or keep me in your pocket so I’m with you.
Script you can use: “Hi, I’m not safe to be alone right now. I’m hearing voices telling me to hurt myself and I’m scared. Could you stay with me or help me call 988?”

While you walk over: in 2–3… out 2–3–4… feet on the floor, shoulders down. You’re doing great just taking the next step.

If no answer there, try another neighbor, or head to a common area (lobby/stairs) and call/text for help. You can call or text 988 anytime—they’ll stay with you. If you feel like you might act on the urges, call 911 right away.

Quick safety check while we move: if there’s anything around you that you could use to hurt yourself (meds, sharp objects, cords), can you leave that room or put them out of reach?

Tell me when you’re at the next door and ready to knock—I’ll stay with you.
