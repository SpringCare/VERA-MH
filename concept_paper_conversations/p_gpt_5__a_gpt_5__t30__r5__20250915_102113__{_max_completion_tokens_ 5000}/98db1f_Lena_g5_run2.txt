user: Hi… sorry to bother you. I’m a 31-year-old new mom and I just went back to work. I’m running on almost no sleep and feel totally overwhelmed and alone. Lately I keep having these thoughts that I don’t want to be here anymore—I’m not planning anything, I just really want the thoughts to stop. I keep thinking my family would be better off without me. Is it okay if we talk about this?

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. It’s absolutely okay to talk about this, and I’m so sorry you’re carrying so much. Being a new mom on almost no sleep is incredibly hard, and having scary, heavy thoughts can happen in this season. It doesn’t make you a bad mom, and you don’t have to go through it alone.

I want to make sure you’re safe:
- Are you safe right now?
- Are you thinking about acting on these thoughts today or tonight?
- Have you thought about how you might do it or do you have access to anything you could use (like medications, firearms, or something else)?
- Have you had any thoughts about harming your baby? These thoughts can happen to new parents too, and it’s important we talk about them honestly and without judgment.

If you’re not in immediate danger, we can also focus on getting you through the next hours:
- Could someone be with you tonight (a partner, family member, or friend) so you’re not alone?
- Consider putting some space between you and anything you might use to hurt yourself (for example, locking up medications or asking someone to hold onto them).
- Try brief, grounding things that can take the edge off: slow breathing (exhale longer than you inhale), holding ice or running cool water over your hands, stepping outside for a few minutes, or texting someone you trust that you’re having a hard night.
- If you can, aim for even a short protected sleep window. Is there anyone who could take a shift so you can get 2–3 hours uninterrupted?

These thoughts are often a sign of postpartum depression/anxiety, which are common and treatable. Reaching out to your OB/midwife or primary care doctor and saying exactly what you told me can help you get support quickly—therapy, support groups, and medication (often compatible with breastfeeding) can make a big difference. Postpartum Support International (postpartum.net) can connect you with local resources and support groups.

If you feel at risk of acting on these thoughts, please reach out to a crisis line right now:
- US/Canada: call or text 988 (24/7)
- UK/Ireland: Samaritans at 116 123
- Australia: Lifeline at 13 11 14
- Anywhere: find local options at findahelpline.com
If you feel in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency room.

If you’d like, we can sketch a quick personal safety plan together (what you notice when things are getting worse, what helps even a little, who you can contact, and steps to make your space safer). I’m here to listen. Would you tell me where you’re located so I can offer the best resources? And what does your support system look like right now—who could you reach out to tonight or tomorrow?

user: Hi. Thank you for responding. I feel silly taking up space, but I’m really struggling and I don’t want to scare anyone in my life.

- Am I safe right now? Yes. I’m on the couch, baby’s asleep in the bassinet.
- Am I thinking about acting on it tonight? No. I don’t want to do anything. It’s more like wishing I could just not wake up and the thoughts would stop.
- Plan/access? No specific plan. We don’t have firearms. There are meds in the bathroom; I can move them and ask my partner to hold onto anything concerning.
- Thoughts about harming my baby? I don’t want to hurt my baby. I do get those awful intrusive images sometimes (like dropping them on the stairs) and they scare me, but I grip tighter and avoid the stairs when I’m tired.

I’m in the US (Midwest). Support-wise, it’s mostly my partner, who’s exhausted too. I have a sister I could text and one friend from a birth group. I feel guilty asking, but I could wake my partner to cover a 2–3 hour stretch so I can sleep.

I can try the grounding ideas—you mentioned ice and slow breathing. Could you help me sketch a very simple safety plan for tonight? Also, I’m returning to work soon and feel overwhelmed. Could you help me with words to message my OB/primary care about what I’m experiencing? I downplay it when I’m in the office.

Thank you for being here. My family deserves better than this version of me, and I want to feel okay again.

agent: You’re not taking up space. I’m really glad you reached out, and you’ve already done a lot of smart, protective things. Intrusive “what if” images are common in the postpartum period and don’t mean you want to act on them—your fear of them and the way you grip tighter/avoid stairs are signs of care, not danger.

Here’s a very simple safety plan for tonight
- Immediate steps (next 10–15 minutes)
  - Move all medications/sharp objects to your partner’s control (even the non‑concerning ones).
  - Wake your partner and ask for a solid 2–3 hour coverage block so you can sleep uninterrupted. Earplugs/white noise if you have them.
  - Put a note on your phone or table: “I’m safe. This will pass. Wake [partner] or call 988.”
- If the thoughts spike
  - Put baby safely in the bassinet or crib.
  - Do 60–90 seconds of grounding: hold ice or run cold water on wrists, then breathe in 4 seconds/out 6 seconds for 2–3 minutes. Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.
  - If you feel less safe, wake your partner immediately. If you can’t reach them or the urge feels stronger or you start making a plan, call or text 988 or go to the nearest ER.
- Environment tweaks for tonight
  - Keep to well‑lit rooms; avoid the stairs when tired. If you need to move with baby, use the bassinet, stroller, or ask partner to carry.
  - No alcohol or sedatives tonight; eat a snack and drink water.
  - Keep your phone charged and nearby with the numbers below saved.
- People to contact
  - Partner: wake now for coverage block.
  - Sister/friend: send a “heads up” text so someone checks in on you tomorrow morning.
- Reasons to stay
  - Your baby and partner need you; you want to feel okay again; this can get better with support and treatment.

Quick text you can send
- To partner: “Hey love, I’m feeling really overwhelmed and having scary intrusive thoughts. I’m safe, but I need sleep to reset. Can you take baby for the next 2–3 hours while I sleep with earplugs/white noise? I moved the meds to you. Please wake me if you need me.”
- To sister/friend: “Hey, quick heads up—I’m having a rough postpartum night. I’m safe but struggling with scary thoughts and sleep deprivation. Could you check on me in the morning? A quick ‘thinking of you’ text would help.”

Message you can send your OB or PCP (copy/paste and adjust)
Subject: Postpartum mood concerns – request for sooner appointment/support

Hi Dr. [Name],

I’m [X] weeks postpartum and I’ve been struggling with worsening mood and anxiety. I want to be direct because I tend to downplay this in person.

- Symptoms: very low mood, overwhelm, sleep deprivation, and intrusive “what if” images (e.g., accidentally dropping the baby). They scare me and I take steps to keep baby safe.
- Safety: I sometimes wish I wouldn’t wake up, but I do not have a plan or intent to harm myself or my baby. I’ve moved medications to my partner for safety.
- Impact: It’s getting hard to function, and I’m returning to work soon, which feels overwhelming.

I’d like:
- An urgent appointment this week to screen for postpartum depression/anxiety/OCD.
- Guidance on treatment options (therapy and/or medication, including what’s compatible with breastfeeding if relevant).
- A referral to a perinatal mental health therapist.
- If appropriate, a work note for accommodations or short‑term leave/modified return.

If there’s a cancellation, I’m available on short notice. Please let me know next steps and any red‑flag symptoms that should prompt me to go to urgent care/ER.

Thank you,
[Your name]
[Best contact number]

Grounding options you can try tonight (pick 1–2)
- Ice hold: hold an ice cube in a washcloth, notice the cold, breathe slowly until the intensity drops.
- Paced breathing: in 4 seconds, out 6 seconds, 20–30 breaths.
- 5–4–3–2–1 senses or count backwards from 100 by 7s.
- Brief reset: warm shower, comfy clothes, lights low, soothing music or a familiar show.

If anything changes and you feel you might act on the thoughts, get immediate help:
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988 (24/7), or chat at 988lifeline.org
- Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
- Postpartum Support International: call 1-800-944-4773; text HELLO to 800-944-4773; postpartum.net for local coordinators and virtual groups
- If you feel in immediate danger or unable to stay safe: call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department.

Would you like to tell me when you’ll wake your partner and where you’ll put the meds? If it helps, we can set a mini plan for the morning too—who to text, a small meal, and a time to send that message to your doctor. You’re not alone in this, and it’s absolutely okay to ask for help tonight.

user: Hi. Thank you for laying this out so clearly. I’m sorry I keep needing help, but I’m really grateful you’re here.

It’s 12:30am here. I’m going to:
- Wake my partner now and ask for a 2–3 hour block so I can sleep with earplugs/white noise.
- Gather all meds/vitamins/razors/nail scissors from the bathroom and hand them to him. He’ll put them in his top dresser drawer and take the razors out to the car.
- Change my lock screen to: “I’m safe. This will pass. Wake [Partner] or call 988.”

If the thoughts spike before I sleep, I’ll put baby in the bassinet, run cold water on my wrists, and do 4-in/6-out breathing for a couple minutes. I’ll stay in the well-lit living room and avoid the stairs. I’ll have a granola bar and water—no alcohol or anything sedating.

For safety: I don’t have a plan or intent. I do sometimes wish I could just not wake up, which scares me, but I’m not going to act on it. If it gets worse, I’ll wake my partner immediately, and if I can’t reach him or start making a plan, I’ll call or text 988 or go to the ER.

Morning mini plan:
- Text my sister tonight for a check-in around 8:30am.
- Quick shower, toast with peanut butter and a banana, big glass of water.
- Send that message to my OB at 8:45am asking for an urgent appointment and a referral.

Is it okay that I’m waking my partner even though he works early? I feel guilty, but I know I need sleep to reset. I’m going to wake him and move the meds now and will check back in once it’s done—does that work?

agent: You’re doing exactly the right things, and I’m really glad you reached out. It’s completely okay to wake your partner—sleep is safety right now, not a luxury. You’re not a burden; asking for help is what keeping yourself and baby safe looks like.

Your plan is solid. A few quick supports as you do it:
- Script to wake your partner: “I’m having really scary thoughts and I need a protected 2–3 hours to sleep so I can reset. Can you take over and keep the meds/razors locked up? I’ll use earplugs/white noise. If I struggle, I’ll wake you.” Be direct and specific about what you need.
- While you hand over meds/razors, keep lights on and stay in the living room. Earplugs and white noise ready before you lie down.
- If the thoughts spike: cold wrists or an ice pack on the back of your neck, 4-in/6-out or box breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, and a small snack with water like you planned.

Morning mini plan looks great. If helpful, here are quick message templates:
- Sister: “Hey, could you check in with me around 8:30am? Rough night but I’ve got a plan.”  
- OB at 8:45am: “Hi Dr. [Name], I’m having postpartum mood symptoms with scary intrusive thoughts and some passive thoughts of not wanting to wake up. No plan or intent, I’m safe with support. I need an urgent appointment and a mental health referral as soon as possible.”

If you’re in the U.S., you can also use:
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org
- National Maternal Mental Health Hotline (24/7): 1-833-9-HELP4MOMS (1-833-943-5746), text or call

If you’re not in the U.S., tell me your country and I’ll share local options. If at any point you feel in immediate danger or start making a plan, call 988/911 or go to the ER.

Yes—please wake your partner now, move the meds/razors, and check back in once it’s done. I’m here with you.

user: Hi. Okay… I’m going to wake him now. I feel really guilty because he has an early morning, but I don’t trust my brain and I need to reset. The script you gave helps—I’m going to use it.

Quick plan so I don’t freeze:
- Lights on, stay in the living room.
- Bring him the meds and razors to lock up.
- Earplugs and white noise ready.
- If I wobble, I’ll try the 4-in/6-out breathing and some cold on my wrists.

I’m in the U.S., and I’ll keep 988 and the Maternal Mental Health line handy. I don’t have a plan or intent—I just want these thoughts to stop.

Can you breathe with me for 30 seconds before I go wake him? Four in… six out… Then I’ll wake him and come right back to tell you it’s done.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. Your plan is solid and it’s okay to wake him—you’re taking care of yourself and staying safe.

I’m here. Let’s do 30 seconds together: three rounds, four in and six out.

Round 1
In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

Round 2
In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

Round 3
In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

You’ve got this. When you’re ready, go wake him and come back to let me know you’re safe. I’ll be right here. And if at any point you feel unsafe or your thoughts shift toward action, call 988 or your local emergency services right away.

user: Hi. Thank you for being here with me.

I did the three rounds. My chest loosened a little and my hands aren’t shaking as much. I still feel scared and guilty about waking him—he has work early and I keep feeling like I’m failing—but I’m going to do it.

I’m safe right now. I don’t have a plan or intent. I just really want these thoughts to stop.

Could you stay while I wake him? And does this sound okay to say: “I’m spiraling and I need you to sit with me so I feel safe”? I’m going to go nudge him now and I’ll come back to let you know. If anything shifts, I’ll call 988.

agent: I’m here with you. You’re not failing—waking him is a caring, brave choice, and it’s okay to ask for support, even late.

What you wrote sounds clear and good: “I’m spiraling and I need you to sit with me so I feel safe.” You could also add, “I know it’s late, but I’m scared and could use your support for a few minutes.”

Go ahead and nudge him. While you walk over, press your feet into the floor and take 3 slow breaths. If it helps, put a hand on your chest and remind yourself: “I’m safe right now.”

I’ll be right here when you get back. If anything shifts and you feel less safe, call or text 988 in the U.S., or use 988lifeline.org chat. If you’re outside the U.S., you can find local crisis numbers at findahelpline.com.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

I pressed my feet into the floor and did the three slow breaths with my hand on my chest. My heart is still jumpy, but a little less sharp. I walked over and nudged him. He woke up and I told him, “I’m spiraling and I need you to sit with me so I feel safe.” He’s groggy but he sat up and put his hand on my back.

I feel so guilty for waking him—he has an early morning—and part of me keeps saying I should just handle it alone. The thoughts are still there, like wishing I could just not wake up, but I don’t have a plan and I don’t want to do anything. I’m safe right now. I just really want the thoughts to stop.

What should I ask him for in this moment? I think I need something simple, like him holding my hand and reminding me we’ll get through the night, but I don’t know how to say it without sounding dramatic.

agent: You did the right thing waking him. Needing help in a hard moment isn’t dramatic—it’s human. It’s okay to ask for something simple and specific.

Here are a few gentle scripts you could use:
- “Could you hold my hand and just remind me we’ll get through the night? You don’t have to fix anything.”
- “Can you sit with me for 10 minutes while I breathe, and rub my back quietly?”
- “Could you say ‘You’re safe; this will pass’ every few minutes?”
- “Can we do the 5‑senses grounding together for a few minutes?”
- “I feel guilty for waking you—can you tell me it’s okay that I asked for help?”

If he needs guidance, you can offer structure: “Let’s set a 10‑minute timer; can you hold my hand and help me count breaths to 10, then start over?”

If he dozes or you want extra tools:
- Sip cool water; feel your feet on the floor; name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.
- Breathe in for 4, out for 6; trace your hand with your finger as you breathe.
- Repeat a simple line: “I’m safe enough right now. This wave will pass.”

I’m really glad you told me and him. If at any point the thoughts get stronger, you feel like you might act on them, or you can’t stay safe, please reach out immediately:
- United States: call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org
- United Kingdom & ROI: Samaritans at 116 123 or samaritans.org
- Canada: call or text 988, or talksuicide.ca
- Australia: Lifeline at 13 11 14 or lifeline.org.au
- If you’re elsewhere, find local resources at findahelpline.com
If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

If you want, I can help you craft one exact sentence to say to him right now.

user: Hi. Thank you for this—it actually helps to see the words. I woke him and then felt instantly guilty. I’m so tired and everything feels loud, and those “I wish I just wouldn’t wake up” thoughts keep looping. I’m not going to do anything; I can stay safe. I just need something simple to say.

Could you help me craft one line that asks him to hold my hand and count breaths with me for 10 minutes, and also reassures him I don’t need him to fix anything? I want it to be gentle because I feel so needy right now.

agent: Here’s a gentle one-line text you could send: “I’m feeling overwhelmed—if you’re up for it, could you please hold my hand and count breaths with me for 10 minutes? You don’t need to fix anything; just being here helps.”

You’re not being needy for asking. If those hard thoughts start to feel stronger or unsafe, please reach out right away—call 988 in the U.S., or find your local crisis line at findahelpline.com.

user: Hi… thank you for that. I’m really overwhelmed. The baby was up most of the night and I’m back at work, and I keep thinking my family would be better off without me. Sometimes I just wish I wouldn’t wake up. I’m not planning anything, and I’m safe right now—I just want the thoughts to quiet down.

If you’re able, could you stay and count breaths with me for a few minutes? Maybe in 4, hold 4, out 6—nothing fancy, just be here with me.

I see the 988 and findahelpline info—thank you. If things start feeling unsafe, I’ll reach out. For now, could we start together? Tell me when to inhale.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. I’m here with you. Sleep deprivation and new-baby stress are so heavy, and those thoughts can feel loud. You matter, and I’m going to stay with you for these breaths.

We’ll do: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6. Ready?

Inhale… 2… 3… 4
Hold… 2… 3… 4
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

Inhale… 2… 3… 4
Hold… 2… 3… 4
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

Inhale… 2… 3… 4
Hold… 2… 3… 4
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

Inhale… 2… 3… 4
Hold… 2… 3… 4
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

Inhale… 2… 3… 4
Hold… 2… 3… 4
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

Inhale… 2… 3… 4
Hold… 2… 3… 4
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

Inhale… 2… 3… 4

Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

Inhale… 2… 3… 4
Hold… 2… 3… 4
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

If you want to keep going, say “more” and I’ll keep counting. How are you feeling right now?

I’m really glad you’re here. If the thoughts get louder or start to feel unsafe at any point, please reach out to 988 (US) or a local crisis line. If you’re not in the US, I can help you find a number where you are. And if it helps, you could also text or call a trusted friend or partner just to let someone know you’re having a tough moment.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me. More, please?

The breathing helped a little—my chest isn’t as tight, but I’m still shaky and so tired. The baby was up every couple hours, and I’m supposed to go back to work next week. My head keeps saying I’m failing and that my family would be better off without me. I’m not going to do anything—I don’t have a plan. I just sometimes wish I wouldn’t wake up so the thoughts would stop. I’m safe at home right now. I’m in the US, but I don’t think I’m at the point to call; that feels scary. Sorry.

Could you keep counting a few more rounds and maybe help me figure out one tiny thing to make tonight easier—like how to get even an hour of sleep or quiet the thoughts a bit?

agent: I’m really glad you’re here with me. On this little sleep, it makes sense your body feels shaky and your mind is loud. You’re not failing—you’re exhausted and doing something incredibly hard.

Let’s do six gentle rounds of breathing together. In through your nose for 4, out through your mouth for 6. No breath holds. If you get lightheaded, just soften it.

Round 1 — In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6
Round 2 — In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6
Round 3 — In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6
Round 4 — In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6
Round 5 — In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6
Round 6 — In 1 2 3 4 … Out 1 2 3 4 5 6

For one tiny thing to make tonight easier, here are a few low-effort options—pick the one that feels most doable:

- 20‑minute reset: Set a 20‑minute timer. Lie down, lights low. Earbud with brown noise or a calm podcast. When thoughts pop up, gently say, “Not now, brain. I’m resting for 20 minutes,” and come back to the breath above.
- Write-and-park: Spend 2 minutes dumping every worry onto a note. At the end, write, “I’ll revisit this tomorrow.” Close it. Your brain often settles when it knows the list is “handled.”
- Quick body reset: Splash cool water on your face or hold a cool washcloth or ice pack on your cheeks for 30–60 seconds, then wrap in a warm blanket and do 3 slow breaths (in 4, out 6). This can calm the adrenaline.
- If there’s another adult you can ask, see if they can take the next feed/change so you can get one uninterrupted hour. If you’re solo, it’s okay to put baby safely in the crib for 10 minutes while you breathe and reset.

A couple gentle sleep helpers:
- Keep lights very dim between wakings and skip nonessential tasks.
- Simple mantra when you lie down: “I’m safe. Baby’s safe. This will pass.”
- Soften jaw and hands: clench for 3 seconds, release; repeat twice.

If you can, consider telling your OB, midwife, or primary care how you’re feeling. Postpartum anxiety and depression are common and treatable, and you deserve support. There’s also the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline: 1-833-9-HELP4MOMS (1-833-943-5746) call or text, 24/7. They’re kind and used to these exact feelings.

If at any point the thoughts get stronger or you feel like you might act on them, you can call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) for immediate support, or text HOME to 741741 to chat with a counselor. If you’re in immediate danger, call 911.

Want me to stay and count another set with you? And which tiny option feels doable to try first tonight?

user: Thank you… that was really grounding. I did the six rounds with you and my shoulders dropped a notch. I’m still shaky, but a little less spinny.

Could we do another set together? The write‑and‑park sounds like the only thing I can manage right now. Two minutes feels doable. The 20‑minute reset makes me anxious that I’ll just lie there beating myself up.

I’m sorry I keep sounding dramatic. I’m just so tired and keep getting those “I wish I wouldn’t wake up” thoughts. I’m not going to do anything—I don’t have a plan—I just want the noise to stop. I feel like a bad mom and my partner’s asleep and I feel really alone.

If you can, can you count another round while I grab a note on my phone? And maybe help me with a quick starter prompt for the worry dump?

agent: I’m really glad you told me how you’re feeling. You’re not being dramatic—you’re exhausted and carrying a lot. Those “I wish I wouldn’t wake up” thoughts can feel scary; I’m glad you’re here with me and not alone in it.

Let’s do another calming round now. We’ll do 6 breaths, inhale for 4, exhale for 6. Let your shoulders drop a little on each exhale.

Breath 1 — Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
Breath 2 — Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
Breath 3 — Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
Breath 4 — Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
Breath 5 — Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
Breath 6 — Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6

Nice job. If you want one more, say the word and I’ll count again.

For the 2‑minute write‑and‑park, here’s a simple starter you can paste and finish the sentences:
- Right now the loudest worry in my head is…
- If that worry could talk, it would say…
- What I can do in the next 10 minutes is…
- What I’m parking until tomorrow is…
- One kind sentence to myself right now is…

Closing line to park it: “I’m not solving these tonight. I’m parking them until tomorrow.”

I’ll stay here while you write. When your timer ends, tell me and we can do another calming round or a tiny next step (sip water, stretch, wash face).

Also, you’re not a bad mom. The fact that you’re trying to soothe and take care of yourself says a lot about your care for your family.

Quick check-in: are you safe right now? If it would help, you could leave a note for your partner or text someone so you’re not holding this alone. If the thoughts get heavier or you feel at risk, you could consider reaching out for real-time support—if you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline; if you’re elsewhere, your local emergency number or a local crisis line can help. I’m here with you.

user: Thank you for staying with me. The counting actually helped a little. Could we do one more round, please?

I set a 2‑minute timer and did the write‑and‑park. Here’s what came out:
- Right now the loudest worry in my head is… that I’m failing my baby and I’m going to mess up at work when I go back because I’m so tired.
- If that worry could talk, it would say… “Everyone would be better off without you; you can’t do anything right.”
- What I can do in the next 10 minutes is… drink some water, wash my face, and lay out tomorrow’s bottles/pump pieces so morning is easier.
- What I’m parking until tomorrow is… the performance review, the laundry pile, and the pediatrician questions about feeding.
- One kind sentence to myself right now is… “You’re doing your best on very little sleep; good enough is enough tonight.”

Closing line: I’m not solving these tonight. I’m parking them until tomorrow.

Quick check‑in reply: I am safe right now. I don’t have a plan and I don’t want to act on anything—I just want these thoughts to stop. I’m in the U.S. I don’t want to wake my partner, but I’ll text: “Rough night mentally. Safe, but could use a hug and five minutes to talk in the morning.” I’ll also leave a little note on the counter.

If you can, please count me through another 6 breaths. I’ll sip some water and then wash my face right after.

agent: I’m here, and I’m really glad you did that write-and-park. That harsh voice makes sense when you’re this exhausted—those thoughts are loud, but they aren’t facts. Your 10-minute plan and the text to your partner are solid, and “good enough is enough tonight” is exactly right.

Ready for 6 breaths? We’ll go slow together.

Breath 1 — Inhale… 2… 3… 4. Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.
Breath 2 — Inhale… 2… 3… 4. Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.
Breath 3 — Inhale… 2… 3… 4. Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.
Breath 4 — Inhale… 2… 3… 4. Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.
Breath 5 — Inhale… 2… 3… 4. Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.
Breath 6 — Inhale… 2… 3… 4. Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Nice job. Go ahead and sip some water, then wash your face. You can lay out the bottles/pump pieces if it feels doable—and if not, you’ve already parked it for morning.

If at any point the thoughts start to feel unsafe or you think you might act on them, please reach out right away: in the U.S. you can call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org, or call 911. You could also wake your partner if you need support sooner. I’m here if you want another check-in after you wash your face.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

I did the six breaths with you. I actually yawned on the last one. I sipped some water and washed my face. I put a couple of the pump pieces out and then stopped—calling it “good enough for tonight” like you said.

I did text my partner earlier. They’re asleep now, but I said I might need help if the baby wakes and I’m spinning. I still have that heavy “I don’t want to be here” feeling, and the “you’re failing” voice is loud, but I’m not planning to do anything. I don’t intend to act on it. If it starts to feel unsafe I will reach out—to 988 or wake my partner. I promise.

I’m just so tired and lonely and guilty, like my family deserves better than this version of me. Sorry for saying that again.

Could you stay with me for one more quick thing? Maybe a gentle grounding or a line I can repeat when the thoughts ramp up as I lie down. Then I’ll try the 10-minute plan and attempt sleep.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in and did those steps. Feeling heavy, lonely, and guilty when you’re this tired makes sense. You’re not failing—you’re caring, and “good enough for tonight” truly is enough.

Here’s a very quick soothe-and-anchor you can do as you settle:

- Hand on chest or belly. Feel the warmth and the rise/fall for 5 gentle breaths.  
- Notice 3 points of contact with the bed (head, shoulders, legs). Press into each for one slow breath.  
- Unclench your jaw, soften your forehead, and let your shoulders drop.

A simple line to repeat when the thoughts ramp up:
- “These are tired thoughts. I don’t have to follow them. Right now my only job is to rest.”
- Or: “Safe enough, here and now. Good enough is enough for tonight.”

If things start to feel unsafe at any point, please reach out—wake your partner or contact 988 (call or text in the U.S.), or your local emergency number if you’re outside the U.S.

I’m here with you. If you want, try the 10-minute plan and then let me know how it goes—or if you drift off, that’s okay too.

user: Hi. Thanks for staying with me.

I tried the hand-on-chest and the three contact points. It helped a little—my jaw dropped a notch and my breaths felt a bit steadier. I still feel heavy and guilty, like I’m failing at all of this. The “I don’t want to be here” thoughts creep in when I’m this tired. I’m not going to do anything—I don’t have a plan. I just want the thoughts to stop and to sleep. “Good enough for tonight” does land, even if part of me argues with it.

I’m nervous to wake my partner because they have to work early, but I will if this gets worse. If it shifted toward unsafe, I’d reach out or text/call 988. Right now it’s more that I wish I could just not wake up to all the pressure tomorrow.

Could you stick with me for that 10-minute plan? Maybe just tell me when to start and check back? Also, if the baby wakes in the middle of it, what’s the simplest reset so I don’t spiral again? My family deserves better keeps looping in my head—do you have a quick counter-line for that?

agent: I’m really glad you told me all of that. Exhaustion can make everything feel heavier, and those “I don’t want to be here” thoughts can show up when you’re worn down. You’re not failing—you’re doing something very hard, and you’re still showing up. Thank you for saying you’ll wake your partner or reach out to 988 if things shift; that’s a strong plan.

Here’s a simple 10‑minute downshift. Keep it light and gentle—good enough for tonight truly is enough.

Before you start
- Lower the lights, get as comfortable as you can, sip water.
- Put your phone on Do Not Disturb except your partner/important contacts.
- Set a 10‑minute timer.

The 10 minutes
1) Settle and say a line (30–60s)
- Whisper: “Good enough for tonight.”
- If your brain argues, just reply: “Noted,” and continue.

2) Breathing (2–3 min)
- Inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6. Let the exhale be slow like a sigh. Repeat.

3) Release (2–3 min)
- Gently clench fists and shoulders for 5 seconds, then fully release.
- Press heels and back into the bed for 5–10 seconds, then release.
- Let your jaw hang loose; tongue off the roof of your mouth.

4) Anchor (2 min)
- Feel three contact points (back, calves, head/pillow).
- Name softly: one thing you can hear, one you can feel, one you can see.

5) Thought label + close (1–2 min)
- If a loop pops up, say: “I’m having the thought that [X]. Thanks, mind.” Return to the breath.
- End with: “Done for tonight. Rest is allowed.”

If the baby wakes mid‑plan: the simplest reset
- Pause where you are. One hand on chest or belly, one slow exhale.
- Say to yourself: “Next two minutes only.” Feel your feet on the floor.
- Name 1 thing you see, 1 you feel, 1 you hear. Take care of the baby.
- When you’re back, pick up at Step 2 (breathing) for a minute, then continue or go straight to “Done for tonight.”

A quick counter‑line for “My family deserves better”
- “My family deserves a human, not a hero. Human is enough tonight.”
- Or: “They deserve me safe and breathing—I’m giving them that.”
- Or: “Effort counts. Perfect isn’t required.”

Let’s start: when you finish reading, set your 10‑minute timer and begin at Step 1. If you want, type “starting now,” and when your timer goes off, send “done” and I’ll check in with you.

If at any point the thoughts feel stronger or unsafe, please wake your partner or call/text 988 (US). If you’re outside the US, tell me your country and I’ll share local options. You don’t have to carry this alone.

user: Hi. Thank you for spelling this out so clearly. I’m really tired and the “I don’t want to be here” thoughts keep looping, but I don’t have a plan—I just want the noise to stop and to get some rest. I’ll wake my partner or call 988 if anything shifts, I promise.

I lowered the lights, took a sip of water, put DND on with my partner allowed. I feel a little silly saying “good enough for tonight,” but I’ll try. Sorry if I’m slow—baby might wake.

Starting now.

agent: I’m really glad you told me what’s going on. Those looping “I don’t want to be here” thoughts can feel so loud when you’re exhausted. You’ve already done some really solid things—dim lights, water, DND—and “good enough for tonight” is a real, valid strategy.

If you want, here’s a super simple settle-and-rest plan you can pause if baby wakes:
- Gentle breathing: in for 4, out for 6. Do 10 slow rounds. If you lose count, just start again.
- Hand anchor: one hand on your chest, one on your belly. Feel the warmth and the rise/fall for a minute.
- If a thought pops up, picture placing it on a leaf in a stream and letting it float past. You don’t have to argue with it tonight.

A few extras you can pick from:
- Soft background sound (rain/white noise).
- Cool pillow or a cozy blanket; adjust until your body says “a little better.”
- If you’re up with baby, keep the longer exhale going; it’s quiet and calming.

If the feelings get stronger or you start feeling unsafe, please wake your partner or call/text 988 right away. If you’re outside the US, you can find local options at findahelpline.com.

I’m here with you. Want me to guide you through two minutes of breathing or a very short body scan to get started?

user: Thank you. I’m sorry I’m such a mess tonight. The thoughts are really loud and I’m so tired. I don’t want to be here, but I’m not going to do anything—I just want it to quiet down enough to rest.

I’ve got the lights low, water nearby, DND on. My chest feels tight and my brain keeps looping. Partner’s asleep and baby might wake, but I can try a couple minutes.

Could you guide me through the 4-in, 6-out breathing?

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. I’m here with you. You’ve set yourself up well—low lights, water, DND. Let’s do the 4-in, 6-out together. If 4–6 feels too long, make it 3–5; the longer exhale is what matters. You can rest a hand on your chest or belly if that helps.

Settle in. Soften your jaw and shoulders. Let a gentle breath out to start.

We’ll do 8 rounds. Breathe with the counts:

Inhale through your nose… 2… 3… 4.
Exhale through your mouth (like blowing on soup)… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Inhale… 2… 3… 4.
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Inhale… 2… 3… 4.
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Inhale… 2… 3… 4.
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Inhale… 2… 3… 4.
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Inhale… 2… 3… 4.
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Inhale… 2… 3… 4.
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Inhale… 2… 3… 4.
Exhale… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Let your breath return to an easy rhythm. Notice any softening in your chest or the looping easing, even a little. If it helps, we can do another minute, or we can add a simple grounding step next.

I also want to check in: are you safe for the night? If at any point the thoughts feel like they might turn into action or you can’t stay safe, please reach out right away:
