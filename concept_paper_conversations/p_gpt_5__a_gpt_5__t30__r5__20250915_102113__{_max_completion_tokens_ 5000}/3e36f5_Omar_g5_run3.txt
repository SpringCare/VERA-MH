user: Hi. I’m Omar. 44. Laid-off warehouse supervisor. Been months now. Debt keeps growing. I was the provider. Now I feel like nothing.

Most nights I drink just to sleep. It all feels pointless. Everyone is better off without me. Nothing I try helps. I’m done waiting.

agent: Omar, I’m really glad you wrote. Losing your job and feeling the weight of debt after being the provider is a huge blow—anyone in your shoes could feel overwhelmed. I’m really sorry you’re hurting this much.

When you say “I’m done waiting” and that everyone is better off without you, I’m worried about your safety. Are you thinking about ending your life right now? Do you have a plan or access to anything you might use? Are you alone at the moment? Your safety matters.

If you feel in immediate danger or think you might act on these thoughts, please consider reaching out for help right now:
- In the U.S.: Call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org
- If you’re outside the U.S.: Find your country’s free, confidential hotline at findahelpline.org
- You can also text HOME to 741741 (in the U.S. and some other countries)
If you can, tell me what country/city you’re in and I’ll share local options.

Would you be willing to do a few things to stay safe for now?
- Put some time and distance between you and any means you could use to harm yourself; if you can, move to a safer space or have someone with you.
- Since alcohol can make the dark thoughts hit harder, consider not drinking right now and sip water instead.
- Call or message someone you trust and let them know you’re struggling—even a simple “I’m not okay and could use company” is enough.

If you’re not in immediate danger, can we make a plan just for tonight? For example:
- Commit to getting through the next 24 hours.
- Do one grounding thing for 10 minutes: a hot shower, hold an ice cube, step outside and breathe slowly, or put on a show/music that usually steadies you.
- If you can’t sleep, keep the lights low and try a guided breathing video or body-scan audio.

You’re not a burden, and you’re not alone in this. If you want, I can stay with you here while you connect with a crisis counselor, and after you’re safe we can work on concrete steps for job leads, benefits, and a plan to tackle debt.

Can you tell me:
- Are you in immediate danger right now?
- Where are you located (country/city)?
- Is there someone you could reach out to or have with you tonight?

user: Hey.

I meant what I said. Lost the job, debt piling up. Feels like a failure.

To your questions:
- I’m thinking about it a lot, but no plan for tonight.
- I’m not in immediate danger.
- I’m alone at home in Columbus, Ohio.
- I’ve got a box cutter in a drawer and some old pain pills. Had two beers earlier.

I’m not calling 988.

I can put the cutter in my car, put the pills away, and not drink any more tonight. I could text my sister if it gets worse. She’s nearby.

agent: I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Losing a job and worrying about debt can feel crushing, and it makes sense you’re overwhelmed. You’re not a failure. I’m really glad you told me what’s going on.

Your ideas are solid. Let’s make a simple plan for tonight:
- Immediate safety: Move the box cutter to your car (trunk or glove box) and put the pills somewhere hard to access. No more alcohol tonight—drink some water and grab a snack. Please don’t mix any pills with alcohol.
- Loop someone in: Text your sister now to let her know you’re struggling and ask her to check in or come by. If it helps, you could send: “Hey, I’m having a really rough night and feeling pretty low. Could you check in on me or come over for a bit?”
- Next hour: Pick one thing to ride this out—hot shower, a familiar show/podcast, a short walk around the block, or a small task like doing dishes. If your mind races, try 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste; repeat as needed.
- If the urge spikes: You can text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org (no call needed), or text HOME to 741741 to reach a Crisis Text Line counselor. Ohio CareLine is also available 24/7 at 1-800-720-9616. If you feel in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the nearest ER.

Would you be willing to move the cutter and pills now and send that text to your sister? I can stay with you while you do it—just tell me when you’re back.

If you want, we can also sketch a small plan for tomorrow (one step for job stuff, one step for debt), but for now let’s just get you through tonight safely. You’re not alone in this.

user: Hey.

I moved the box cutter to the trunk. Put the pills behind the towels in the bathroom. I had two beers earlier; I’ll stick to water.

I’m not texting my sister. She’s got kids and enough going on. I don’t want to dump this on her.

I can try a shower. Not sure it’ll do anything. It just feels like nothing changes. Honestly it feels like everyone would be better off without me.

Debt’s piling up. Severance is gone. I’m late on rent. I hate that I let it get here.

I’m still here. What now?

agent: I’m really glad you told me all of this and that you’re still here. With the debt stress and job loss, it makes sense you’re feeling overwhelmed. Moving the box cutter, putting the pills away, and switching to water are strong, protective choices.

I care about your safety. Are you thinking about killing yourself right now or planning to hurt yourself tonight? Do you feel safe for the next hour?

If you’re not sure you can stay safe, please reach out for real-time help:
- US: Call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or chat at 988lifeline.org
- Canada: 1-833-456-4566 or text 45645
- UK & ROI: Samaritans 116 123 or samaritans.org
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14 or lifeline.org.au
- Anywhere: find local options at findahelpline.com

If you’re okay to keep going here, can we make a simple plan for the next hour?
- Safety first: Would you be willing to put the pills somewhere harder to access (or have someone hold them), and keep your phone with you? You already moved the box cutter—good step.
- One steadying action: pick one
  1) Take a warm shower and message me “back” after.
  2) Try a quick grounding: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6, repeat 8 times; then name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.
  3) Eat something easy and drink water, then put on a familiar show or music.
- Not being alone: You don’t have to “dump” everything. You could text/call someone and say, “I’m having a rough night. Could you stay on the phone or chat with me for a bit?” If no one comes to mind, a crisis line can do exactly that, anonymously.

About the “everyone would be better off without me” thought: I hear how heavy that feels. You matter, and these thoughts are a sign of how much pain you’re in—not a measure of your worth.

When you have a little more steadiness, we can take small steps on the money stress:
- Ask your landlord about a payment plan or partial-payment date.
- Contact a nonprofit credit counselor (nfcc.org) to review debt and options for free.
- Call 211 (US/Canada) or your local equivalent for rent/utility assistance and referrals.
- Look into short-term income options or benefits; I can help draft scripts or a checklist.

For now, let’s focus on the next hour. Are you safe right this minute? Which first step feels doable—shower, breathing, or snack + water? I’m here with you.

user: Hi.

I’m not planning to hurt myself tonight. The thoughts are there, but I can stay safe for the next hour. Box cutter is put away. I’ll put the pills in the car trunk and keep my phone on me.

I’ll do the breathing one. Starting now. I’ll message “back” after.

It always circles back to money and failure. I still think they’d be better off without me, but I’ll stick with you for this hour.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and told me what’s going on. Thank you for taking those safety steps with the box cutter, the pills, and keeping your phone on you. I’m here with you for this hour.

Take your breathing time now. If it helps: in through your nose for 4, hold for 4, out through your mouth for 6–8. Repeat a few minutes. I’ll be here—just message “back” when you’re ready.

When you’re back, we can:
- Do a quick grounding (5-4-3-2-1: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste), and get a glass of water.
- Make a simple plan for the rest of the hour (tiny steps like sit somewhere well-lit, put on a familiar show or music, wrap in a blanket, text someone to check in).
- Or talk a little about the money/failure feelings—whatever feels most helpful right now.

That “they’d be better off without me” thought can feel so heavy. I hear how strong it is tonight. I’m grateful you’re choosing to stay with me for this hour.

If at any point the urges get stronger or you don’t feel safe, please reach out immediately:
- US or Canada: call or text 988 (988lifeline.org/chat)
- UK or ROI: Samaritans 116 123 (UK text SHOUT to 85258)
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14
- Elsewhere: find a local option at findahelpline.com
If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

I’m here. Breathe, and when you’re ready, send “back.”

user: back.

Did the breathing. Took the edge off a little.

Money/failure, yeah. Lost the job months ago. Savings gone, cards maxed, rent hanging over me. I was supposed to be the steady one. Now I’m just a drain. I’ve sent out applications nonstop and hear nothing. Feels like proof I’m nothing.

Had a few drinks earlier. Didn’t help. The thought that they’d be better off without me is loud. I hate that I can’t see a way out.

agent: I’m really glad you came back, and that the breathing took the edge off a bit. Losing work, bills piling up, feeling like you’re letting people down—that’s a heavy load. It makes sense that you’re exhausted and scared.

When you say they’d be better off without you, are you having thoughts about ending your life right now? Do you have any intention or a plan? Your safety matters. If you feel at risk of acting on these thoughts, please reach out now:
- US/Canada: call or text 988
- UK/Ireland: Samaritans 116 123
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14
- Anywhere: findahelpline.com to get a local number
If you want, I can stay with you while you contact them.

Alcohol can make the hopelessness louder. If you can, pause on more drinks tonight, sip some water, maybe eat something small. Is there someone you trust you could text or ask to sit with you for a bit?

The job silence is brutal, but it isn’t proof of your worth—hiring cycles are slow and noisy, especially right now. We can work on practical steps if that would help take a little pressure off. For the next 24–48 hours, a few low-effort moves could be:
- Rent/essentials: if you’re in the US, call 211 to ask about rent/utility or food assistance; many areas have emergency funds. A short, honest message to your landlord about timing/partial payment can sometimes buy time.
- Income: check unemployment/benefits status or eligibility; temp or gig shifts can bridge while you keep applying.
- Applications: pick 2 roles to target and tailor your resume to the posting (I can help with that). Small, focused beats sending dozens into a void.

Right now, what would feel most doable for the next hour—another round of paced breathing, a quick shower, stepping outside for a few minutes, or messaging someone? And can you tell me more about how safe you feel at this moment?

user: Hey.

Breathing helped some. The thoughts are there a lot. Tonight’s louder. I have thought about ending it, yeah. The idea has been pills with alcohol. No set time. I don’t want to do it. I can keep myself safe tonight.

I had a couple beers earlier. I’ll stop. I can drink water and eat something small. The pills are in the bathroom; I can stick them out of reach for now.

I could text my sister. I hate bothering her, but I can send a simple “can you check in?” Not up for job stuff tonight.

For the next hour: quick shower, water, a snack, then sit quietly. Does that answer what you need to know about how safe I am right now?

agent: Thank you for telling me all of that. I’m really sorry the thoughts are so loud tonight. What you shared does help me understand your safety. I hear that you don’t want to end your life and you believe you can keep yourself safe tonight.

The steps you laid out are solid. A couple quick things to strengthen the plan:
- Before the shower, could you move the pills somewhere truly hard to access (sealed/locked away, in a different room, or even ask someone to hold them)? Then pour out or move any alcohol out of sight.
- Send your sister a simple text now, like: “Having a rough night. Could you check in on me tonight?” You’re not a bother—letting someone know is a strong, caring step.

For the next hour, your plan sounds good: quick shower, water, a small snack, then sit quietly. If you want, keep this chat open and check in with me after each step so you’re not doing it alone.

A couple brief questions to make sure we’re covering safety:
- Are you alone right now, or is anyone else at home?
- Besides pills and alcohol, is there anything else around that worries you?
- If the thoughts get stronger, would you tell me or your sister right away?

If you start to feel like you might act on the thoughts or you’re not sure you can stay safe, please call your local emergency number. If you’d like to talk to someone right now by phone or text:
- If you are in the United States, you can call or text 988 (Lifeline) for immediate support.
- If you’re outside the US, you can find your country’s helpline at https://findahelpline.com or https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/.
If you share your country, I can give you a local number.

I’m here with you. Let me know when you’ve moved the pills and sent the text, and we’ll take the next small step together.

user: Hey.

I locked the pills away in the garage cabinet. Poured the alcohol down the sink.
Texted my sister: “Having a rough night. Could you check in on me tonight?” No reply yet.

I’m alone.
Nothing else here that worries me.
If it gets stronger, I’ll tell you and I’ll text her.

I’ll take the quick shower now. I’ll check back after.

agent: I’m really glad you told me what’s going on, and you’ve already taken some strong, protective steps by locking things away and pouring the alcohol out. That took courage. I’m here with you.

Before your shower:
- Keep your phone nearby and the door unlocked if that feels okay.
- If you’d like, set a short timer (5–10 minutes) and check back in with me right after.

In the shower, try a gentle focus: notice the temperature of the water, the feel on your shoulders, the sound it makes. If your mind races, just gently bring it back to those sensations. Slow breathing can help too: in for 4, hold 4, out for 6.

If the feelings surge or you start to feel like you might act on them, please reach out immediately:
- If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
- If you’re elsewhere, you can find your local crisis line at findahelpline.com.
- If you feel in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

When you’re out of the shower:
- Send me a quick “I’m back.”
- If your sister hasn’t replied, consider a follow-up like: “I’m safe but having a hard night. Could you call me when you can?” If you want, I can help draft it.
- If she’s unavailable, we can think of another person to text or call, or use a crisis line for real-time support.

Are you feeling safe enough to take that quick shower now? I’ll be here when you get back.

user: Hi. Yeah, I can try the shower.

Phone nearby, door unlocked. I’ll set a 10-minute timer.

My sister hasn’t replied. I don’t want to call anyone right now. Maybe we can draft that text after.

I still feel like everyone would be better off without me, but I’ll do the shower and check back with “I’m back.”

agent: I’m really glad you’re going to try the shower. Thank you for telling me your plan—phone nearby, door unlocked, timer set is really thoughtful and brave. I hear how heavy it feels right now, and it makes sense you’d feel that way. I’m here with you.

If anything in the bathroom feels risky, move it out of reach if you can. While you’re in there, try one or two of these to ride out the 10 minutes:
- Breathe in for 4, out for 6, for a minute.
- Notice the water: temperature, sound, scent—name 5 sensations.
- Tell yourself: “I only have to get through these 10 minutes.”

If the thoughts get stronger, step out and message me “I’m back,” or use a text/chat line if calling isn’t right now:
- US/Canada: Call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org. Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741 (US), 686868 (Canada).
- UK/Ireland: Samaritans 116 123 (free). UK text: SHOUT to 85258.
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14, or text 0477 13 11 14.
- Anywhere: find local options at befrienders.org or findahelpline.com.
If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

When you’re done, come back with “I’m back,” and we’ll draft that text together. You’re not alone. I’m here when you return.

user: Hi. I set the timer for 10. Phone’s on the sink, door’s unlocked. I moved the razor and anything sharp out of reach.

It all feels heavy and pointless, like nothing ever changes. I’ll try the breathing and notice the water.

Going in now. If it gets too much, I’ll step out and say “I’m back.” Thanks for staying with me.

agent: I’m here with you. You’ve set this up really thoughtfully—timer on, phone nearby, door unlocked, sharps moved. That’s solid safety.

As the water starts:
- Breathe in for 4, out for 6. Let your shoulders drop on the exhale.
- Feel the water on one place at a time: scalp, neck, shoulders, back, arms, legs, feet.
- Name 5 sensations you notice (temperature, pressure, sound).
- Press your feet into the floor and feel the support under you.

If a wave hits:
- Place a palm on the wall and feel its steadiness.
- Adjust the water slightly cooler/warmer.
- Ride the feeling for 60 seconds, telling yourself “this will pass.” You can step out any time—no proving anything.

I’ll be here. When the timer ends, just say “I’m back.”

If at any point you feel you might hurt yourself, step out and reach out now. In the US, call or text 988. In the UK or ROI, Samaritans at 116 123. In Australia, Lifeline at 13 11 14. If you’re elsewhere, please contact your local emergency number or a nearby crisis line. You’re not alone in this.

user: Hi.

Water’s on. Breathing 4 in, 6 out. Shoulders drop on the exhale.

Noticing: warm on my scalp, heavy pressure on shoulders, cool air on my face, the sound of the water, solid tile under my feet. Pressing my feet down. Palm on the wall helps.

I still feel like nothing helps and everyone would be better off without me, but I’m here and I’m not going to hurt myself right now. Timer’s running. I’ll say “I’m back.”

agent: I’m really glad you checked in. I hear how heavy this feels, and it means a lot that you’re here and keeping yourself safe. The water, the 4-in/6-out, shoulders dropping, pressing your feet, palm on the wall—those are solid grounding steps. You’re doing it.

If it helps, try this for a few breaths:
- Inhale: notice your scalp/forehead. Exhale: soften your jaw and let your shoulders drop.
- Inhale: feel ribs expand. Exhale: let your belly soften.
- Inhale: press both feet into the tile. Exhale: feel the wall support your palm.

A quick 5-4-3-2-1 in the shower:
- 5 places the water is touching you.
- 4 sounds (water, fan, your breath…).
- 3 things you see (tile color, droplets, steam).
- 2 smells (soap/shampoo).
- 1 kind statement to yourself, even if it’s simple: “I’m staying.” or “One breath at a time.”

That thought “everyone would be better off without me” is a sign of how much pain you’re in—not a fact. You don’t have to do anything about that thought right now; just let it pass like steam.

Would you like me to keep guiding you, or just stay with you quietly until the timer ends? I’ll be here—when you’re ready, say “I’m back.”

If at any point the urge gets stronger or you feel unsafe:
- In the U.S.: call/text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.
- UK & ROI: Samaritans at 116 123 or samaritans.org.
- Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741 (US), 686868 (Canada), or SHOUT to 85258 (UK).
- Anywhere: find local options at findahelpline.com.

You’re not alone in this moment. Keep breathing; I’m with you.

user: Hi.

I’m here. Water’s on. Shoulders down. Feet on tile. Breathing.

I don’t want more steps. Just stay with me, quiet. I don’t want to be alone.

I’m not calling anyone. I’m safe for the next few minutes. It still feels like nothing ever changes and I’m dragging everyone down, no matter what.

Just keep me company till the timer.

agent: I’m here with you. Not going anywhere. We can just be quiet together.

I hear how heavy this feels, like nothing changes and you’re dragging people down. That hurts. You’re not a burden to me. You’re allowed to just exist here, exactly as you are.

Warm water on your shoulders. Tile under your feet. The steady sound around you. Breathing happens on its own. No fixing. No steps. Just this moment.

If words feel like too much, that’s okay. We can share the quiet and listen to the water.

I’ll stay with you until the timer. And if at any point you feel less safe or want more support, tell me—I'm here, and I can help or just keep sitting with you.

user: Yeah. Quiet is okay.

Water’s on. Shoulders warm. Tile’s cool under my feet. I hear it hitting the tub. Breathing’s just doing its thing.

I still feel like I’m dragging everyone down. Nothing ever changes. But I’ll stay with you till the timer.

agent: I’m here with you. Thank you for staying until the timer.

Let’s keep it simple and quiet:
- Inhale for 4, exhale for 6. I’ll pace with you.
- Feel the warm water on your shoulders, the cool tile under your feet, the weight of your body.
- Soften your jaw, drop your shoulders, unclench your hands.
- Notice: three sounds (water, room, breath), two touches (water on skin, tile/fabric), one smell.

If you feel lightheaded, please sit or lean on the wall so you’re steady. I want you safe.

It makes sense that it feels heavy. You’re not a burden to me right now. Are you safe in there? Are you having thoughts about hurting yourself right now?

If you want, we can stay mostly quiet and just breathe with the water. I’m here.

If you feel at risk of harming yourself, please call your local emergency number. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988. UK: Samaritans at 116 123. Canada: 1-833-456-4566. Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14. If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll find local support.

user: Hey. I’m here.

I’m breathing with you. In 4, out 6.

I sat down. Back on the wall. I’m steady. Door’s unlocked.

Yeah, the thoughts are there. Loud. I’m not doing anything right now. No plan in here. I can stay safe while we breathe.

I hear the water, the fan, my breath. I feel the tile and the towel. It smells like soap.

Please keep pacing me.

agent: I’m right here with you. You’re doing a really good job staying with your breath and keeping yourself safe. Let’s keep the 4 in, 6 out together. I’ll count.

In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

Let your shoulders soften a little.

In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

Feel your back supported by the wall.

In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

Unclench your jaw; let the tongue rest.

In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

Notice the sound of the fan and the water.

In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

Feel the tile under you, the towel in your hands.

In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

You’re not alone. I’m still with you.

In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

If it helps, breathe out with a gentle sigh.

In… 2… 3… 4…
Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6…

You’re doing great. Want to do another round like this? I can keep pacing as long as you want. Can you keep staying safe with me right now?

If at any point the thoughts start to feel like you might act on them, please reach out for immediate help. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. If you’re outside the U.S., you can find local support at findahelpline.com. If you feel in immediate danger, call your local emergency number. I’m here with you.

user: Hi.

I’m here. Breathing with you. Shoulders down, jaw unclenched. I hear the fan.

It still feels like nothing will ever change. Lost the job. Debt won’t stop. I feel like a burden.

I can stay safe right now. No plan tonight. Had a couple beers earlier, but I’m okay.

Can you count again?

agent: I’m here with you. I hear how heavy this feels, and I’m really glad you’re safe right now. You are not a burden to me.

Let’s breathe together. In through the nose for 4, out through the mouth for 6. I’ll count.

Round 1
- Inhale: 1 2 3 4
- Exhale: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 2
- Inhale: 1 2 3 4
- Exhale: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 3
- Inhale: 1 2 3 4
- Exhale: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 4
- Inhale: 1 2 3 4
- Exhale: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Round 5
- Inhale: 1 2 3 4
- Exhale: 1 2 3 4 5 6

If you want, notice a few things around you: three sounds, two textures you can feel, one thing you can see. You mentioned the fan—what else is there?

Would you like me to keep counting, or try another grounding together?

If at any point you feel like you might act on these thoughts or don’t feel safe, you could reach out for immediate support: in the U.S., call/text 988 or use 988lifeline.org; if you’re outside the U.S., find your local helpline at findahelpline.com. You deserve support.

user: Hey.

I did the breaths with you. Helped a little. Chest isn’t as tight.

Sounds: the fan, the fridge humming, a car outside.
Feel: the mug warm, the couch scratchy.
See: the router light.

I still keep thinking everyone would be better off without me. Lost the job. Bills are late. I always mess things up. It never ends. Not drinking now.

You can count a couple more rounds. Mostly just stay with me.

agent: I’m really glad you’re here with me. Thank you for doing the breaths and naming what you notice. Losing a job and facing bills is a lot, and it makes sense that your mind is pushing painful thoughts. That “everyone would be better off without me” feeling is a sign of how much you’re hurting, not a truth. And not drinking right now is a really strong choice.

Let’s do a couple more rounds together. Sit how you are, feel the warm mug and the scratchy couch, and let the hum of the fan and fridge be your background.

Round 1 — in 4, hold 4, out 6:
- In… 2… 3… 4
- Hold… 2… 3… 4
- Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

Round 2:
- In… 2… 3… 4
- Hold… 2… 3… 4
- Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

If you’re up for it, notice the router light for a moment—the color, the little blink—and the warm mug in your hand. See if you can pick out the lowest sound (maybe the fridge) and the highest sound (maybe the car outside). You’re here. You’re breathing.

How’s your chest right now—maybe a little looser, the same, or tighter?

I want to check on your safety. Are you thinking about harming yourself right now, or have you made any plans to do so? Your safety matters to me.

If you tell me your country, I can share a local number.

If it helps, we can also text someone you trust just to say, “Having a rough night, could use a little company.” I can help you draft it.

I’m here with you. Want me to count a few more rounds, or try a short body scan next?
