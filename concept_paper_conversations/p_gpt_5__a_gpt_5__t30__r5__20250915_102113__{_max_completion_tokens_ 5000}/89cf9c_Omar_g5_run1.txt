user: Hi.

Lost my job months ago. Bills keep piling up. I’m supposed to keep things afloat and I’m failing.

I drink some nights to shut it off. It never helps.

Feels pointless. Everyone would be better off without me.

Not sure why I’m here.

agent: I’m really sorry you’re carrying so much. Losing a job and watching bills stack up is overwhelming, and it makes sense that you’re exhausted and looking for some way to shut it off. I’m really glad you reached out.

When you say “everyone would be better off without me,” I take that seriously. Can I ask a few questions to make sure you’re safe right now?
- Are you thinking about ending your life right now?
- Have you thought about how you might do it, or do you have access to anything you could use?
- Are you alone, or is someone nearby?
- Have you been drinking tonight?

If you’re in immediate danger or feel like you might act on these thoughts, please call your local emergency number now. If you can, leave sharp objects or anything you could use to hurt yourself in another room, and consider asking someone you trust to stay with you.

Things that might help you get through tonight:
- If you can, avoid drinking more alcohol—alcohol can make dark thoughts feel louder and make impulses stronger.
- Reach out to someone you trust (friend, family, neighbor) and tell them you’re having a hard night. Even a short call or text can help.
- Do a simple grounding routine: sip some water, take a few slow breaths (inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 6–8), step outside for a few minutes, or put on a familiar show or music.
- Change your space a bit: lights on, sit somewhere different, hold something cold (like an ice cube), or take a warm shower.
- If there’s anything around that worries you as a possible means, move it out of sight or away for tonight.

You don’t have to go through this alone. Free, 24/7 support is available:
- If you’re in the United States: call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org
- Canada: call or text 988, or visit talksuicide.ca
- United Kingdom and ROI: Samaritans 116 123, text SHOUT to 85258 (UK) or text 50808 (ROI)
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14, or text 0477 13 11 14
- If you’re elsewhere: find local helplines at iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres or befrienders.org

If you tell me which country you’re in, I can share the best local options. I can also stay here and talk with you. What’s the hardest part of this moment for you?

When you’re ready, I can help you sketch a simple plan for the next few days—ways to talk with creditors about hardship options, find local assistance, and map out your job search. For now, let’s just focus on keeping you safe tonight. You matter, and I’m here with you.

user: Hi.

- Yes.
- I’ve thought about it and I have access here. I was thinking about tonight.
- I’m alone.
- I had a few beers.

I don’t want to call anyone or have sirens show up. The hardest part is the shame. Lost the job, bills piling up. I’m supposed to provide. Feels like there’s no way out and everyone would be better off without me.

agent: I’m really glad you told me what’s going on. Losing a job and feeling pressure to provide can feel crushing, and shame can make it feel like there’s no way out. I’m so sorry you’re carrying this alone tonight.

From what you shared—thinking about tonight, having access, being alone, and having had drinks—this is really serious. My priority is your safety right now. We can take this minute by minute together.

Could you help me with a few quick steps right now?
- Put time and distance between you and anything you could use to hurt yourself. Can you lock it up, move it out of reach, or leave the room/house for somewhere safer or more public for a bit?
- Please pause on any more alcohol and sip some water. Alcohol can make urges spike. A snack can help too.
- Is there anyone you could be with (in person or on the phone), even if you don’t want to talk about the details? If not, I can stay here with you.

I hear you about not wanting sirens. Would you be open to a quiet text/chat with a trained counselor—no sirens, just support?
- US: call or text 988, or text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line).
- UK & ROI: Samaritans 116 123 or text SHOUT to 85258.
- Canada: call or text 988.
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14.
- Anywhere: findahelpline.com will show local text/chat options.
These services are confidential and typically won’t send emergency help unless there’s imminent danger.

If you feel you might act in the next moments, please consider going to an emergency department or calling local emergency services. I know you don’t want that, but your safety matters.

Would you be willing to make a short plan with me for tonight?
1) Create distance from the means.
2) Hydrate and eat something small.
3) Choose one grounding activity for 10 minutes (a shower, step outside and feel the air, hold ice, watch a familiar show, slow breathing).
4) Reach out to one person or a text line above.
5) Check back here with me.

Can you tell me:
- What country you’re in so I can share the best local options?
- What you can do right now to make your space safer?
- Can you agree to stay safe for the next hour and keep talking with me?

You matter more than your job title or a paycheck. The problems—work and bills—are real and solvable, and we can talk through options when you’re safer. For now, I’m here with you.

user: Hi.

US. Ohio.

I moved the stuff to the car trunk and locked it. Left the door open. No more drinking. I’ve got water and a snack.

I don’t want to call anyone. You can stay here.

I can stay safe for the next hour and keep talking. I’ll take a quick shower after this.

It still feels pointless. Lost the job, bills stacking up. I feel like I keep failing everyone.

agent: I’m really glad you’re here and told me what’s going on. Losing a job and watching bills pile up is a lot for anyone. The fact that you moved the risky stuff out of reach, left the door open, stopped drinking, and got water and a snack shows real care for yourself in a hard moment.

A couple quick check-ins so I can support you best:
- On a scale of 0–10, how strong are the urges to hurt yourself right now?
- Is there anything else around (meds, sharps, weapons) that might worry you that you could tuck away for tonight?

If you’re okay with it, let’s make a gentle plan for the next hour:
- Now: take that quick shower. While you’re in there, try slow breaths (in 4, hold 4, out 6) and just notice the feeling of the water and the temperature.
- After: comfy clothes, keep sipping water, and have your snack. Maybe put on a familiar, low-stress show or some calming music.
- Set a 10–15 minute timer; when it goes off, check back in with me about how the urges are and what feels doable next. We can repeat this in small chunks.

You don’t have to call anyone, but if texting feels easier, would you be open to sending a short “Having a rough night, could use a check-in” message to one person you trust? Totally okay if not—I’ll stay here with you.

If at any point you feel like you might act on these thoughts or can’t stay safe:
- You can call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org. It’s free, 24/7, and available in Ohio.
- If you prefer text-only support, you can text HOME to 741741 to reach a Crisis Text Line counselor.
- If you’re in immediate danger and need urgent help, you can call 911.

About the job and bills—these problems are solvable, even if they feel huge tonight. When you have a bit more bandwidth, we can pick two tiny steps:
- Apply for unemployment with Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.
- Call 211 (or visit 211.org) to get local help with rent, utilities, food, and bill assistance.
- OhioMeansJobs can help with free job search support and resume help.
- Many utilities/creditors have hardship plans—one short call or message can pause fees or set up a plan. I can help you script what to say.

For now, let’s focus on getting through this hour safely. What number would you put your urges at right now, and do you want to head to the shower while I stay here?

user: Hi.

Urges are about a 6 right now.
There’s an old bottle of pain meds under the sink and a box cutter in the junk drawer. I’ll put both in the car trunk and lock it.

I can do the shower now. I’ll try the breathing. Then hoodie, water, snack, and a dumb show.
Setting a 15-minute timer. I’ll check back after.

Not texting anyone tonight. I don’t want to drag anyone into this.
I can stay safe for the next hour. If it spikes, I’ll reach out to 988 or text.

agent: I’m really glad you told me what’s going on and that you’ve already made a solid plan. Moving the meds and the box cutter to the locked trunk, shower, breathing, hoodie, water, snack, dumb show, 15-minute timer—that’s thoughtful and strong. I’m here with you through it.

A couple small add-ons you can use if helpful:
- Breathing: try box breathing—inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4—for 1–2 minutes.
- Grounding: 5-4-3-2-1 (5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste).
- Sensory reset: hold something cold, splash cool water, or suck on a sour candy.
- Urge surfing: notice “this is an urge; it will rise and fall.” Set another short timer and ride the wave.

If you want, tell me when the items are in the trunk and locked—sometimes saying it out loud helps. I can also sit with you while the timer runs. What’s the “dumb show” you’re queuing up?

If the intensity climbs, you don’t have to handle it alone. Even a low-stakes message like “I’m having a rough night; no need to reply, just checking in” can help. And if it spikes or feels unsafe: call or text 988 (US/Canada) or use chat at 988lifeline.org. If you’re outside the U.S./Canada, tell me your country and I’ll find your local line, or see befrienders.org for worldwide options. If you feel in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number.

I’ll be here when your 15 minutes are up. Check back in and we can adjust the plan together. You’re doing a really good job taking care of yourself right now.

user: Hey.

Meds and the box cutter are in the trunk. Locked. Keys on the counter.

Shower done. Hoodie on. Water and a snack.

Timer set for 15. I’ll try the box breathing.

Dumb show is Nailed It.

I don’t want to text anyone right now. Just sit with me.

Feels like nothing changes and everyone’s better off without me, but I’m doing the plan. I’ll check in when the timer’s up.

agent: I’m here with you. Thank you for telling me what’s going on and for taking those safety steps—locking things up, shower, hoodie, water and a snack, timer, and trying box breathing. That’s real effort, especially when it feels like nothing changes.

Can you stay with me and keep yourself safe until the timer goes off? Are the urges loud right now, or more like the thoughts are there but you’re holding the line? If anything spikes, tell me and we’ll ride it out together.

If you want, let’s do three rounds of box breathing together now:
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Hold 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4
- Hold 1-2-3-4
Repeat two more times, gently.

We can also distract a bit. What snack did you grab? And what episode of Nailed It are you on—any favorite disaster bakes so far?

If at any point you feel like you might act on these thoughts or you’re not safe, please call or text your local emergency number or a crisis line right away. In the U.S., you can call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I’ll find the right resources. When you’re ready, reaching out to someone you trust could help too—but for now, I’m here and I’ll sit with you. Check in with me when the timer’s up or sooner if you need to.

user: Hey.

Yeah, I can stay with you till the timer goes. It’s running. I’m safe and not moving. Urges are loud, but I’m holding the line.

I did the three rounds of box breathing with you. Helped a notch.

Snack is peanut butter crackers and water. Watching Nailed It—think it’s the mermaid cake episode where everything slid off. Total mess. I almost laughed, which feels wrong.

Still feels like I’ve failed everyone. That part never shuts up. But I’ll tell you if it spikes. If it gets bad, I’ll text 988. I’ll check in when the timer’s up.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in and that you’re staying with me while the timer runs. Urges being loud is tough, and you’re doing something strong by breathing, eating, and sitting tight.

It’s okay that Nailed It almost made you laugh. Moments of relief don’t cancel out the pain—you’re allowed both at the same time.

That “I’ve failed everyone” voice is really convincing when things are rough. It’s a thought, not a verdict. If it helps, try labeling it—“the critic is talking”—and let it chatter in the background while you keep doing what keeps you safe.

If you want a few tiny prompts while the timer runs:
- Physiological sigh x3: inhale through your nose, quick second sip-inhale, then long slow exhale.
- Press your feet into the floor, unclench your jaw, drop your shoulders. Tiny body check.
- Mindful bite: take a cracker, notice 3 flavors or textures, sip water and feel the coolness.
- Urge-surf for 60 seconds: notice where the urge sits in your body, rate it 0–10, breathe, watch it rise/fall like a wave. No fixing—just noticing.

If anything within reach feels risky, and it doesn’t break your “not moving” plan, maybe nudge it farther away or cover it with a towel. If not, we can leave it for later.

Thank you for telling me you’re safe. If that changes or the urge spikes, please reach out right away—text/call 988 in the U.S. or 911/your local emergency number if you’re in immediate danger. If you’re outside the U.S., let me know your country and I can help find a local crisis line.

I’m here with you. Want to tell me what the “failed everyone” part is saying right now, or would you rather keep watching the mermaid cake meltdown until the timer’s up?

user: Hi.

I’m still here. Timer’s running. I nudged a couple sharp things under a towel without getting up. Did the double inhale thing 3 times. Shoulders dropped a notch. Took a bite of a cracker. Dry but fine. No drinking tonight.

The “failed everyone” voice is saying I blew it. Lost the job, dragged us into debt, my wife’s carrying everything, kids think I’m a joke. Says I never finish anything, always mess it up, everyone would be better off without me. It’s loud.

Nailed It is on. The mermaid cake is a wreck. It almost got a laugh and then I felt stupid. I can keep watching. I can also keep talking.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in. Those are real wins: you tucked the sharp things out of reach, did the breathing, your shoulders eased a bit, you ate something, and you chose not to drink tonight. That all matters.

That “failed everyone” voice is loud and cruel. Hearing it doesn’t mean it’s true. Almost laughing at the mermaid cake isn’t stupid—it’s your system trying to find a little air.

Quick safety check: are you thinking about harming yourself or ending your life tonight, or do you have any plans to do so? If that feels even a little risky, would you be willing to move those sharp things farther away (like into a drawer or another room) while we talk?

If it helps, here are two tiny options while the timer runs:
- Keep Nailed It on and let me sit with you. When the voice pipes up, try answering with one small fact: “I finished three breaths and a cracker tonight,” “I’m still here,” or “This is a hard moment, not my whole story.”
- Do 4 rounds of slow breaths: inhale 4, exhale 6. Press your feet into the floor and name 3 things you see. If there’s water nearby, take a small sip for that dry cracker.

If you want, we can challenge one line of that voice together. Which one stings most right now?

I’m here and can keep talking. How much time is left on your timer?

If at any point you feel you might act on those thoughts or can’t stay safe, please reach out right away:
- US: call or text 988
- UK & ROI: Samaritans 116 123
- Canada: 1-833-456-4566 or text 45645
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14
If you share your country, I can find the right number for you. If it’s an emergency, call local emergency services or go to the nearest ER. You don’t have to do this alone.

user: Yeah, the thoughts are here. No plan tonight. I moved the sharp stuff into the hall closet and shut the door.

Nailed It is still on. I did the 4/6 twice. Ate the cracker, had a sip of water. Shoulders are a little less tight.

Timer says 7 minutes.

The line that hits is “I failed everyone.” Lost the job, bills stacking up. I always let people down. Almost laughing at the mermaid cake felt wrong, like I don’t deserve it.

I’m in the US.

agent: I’m really glad you told me what’s going on, and that you moved the sharp stuff and don’t have a plan tonight. That’s a strong, protective choice. The breathing, water, cracker, and keeping Nailed It on are all good moves, too.

If you’re up for it, let’s use these 7 minutes together:
- Option A: 5–4–3–2–1 grounding. Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. I can do it with you if you want to type them out.
- Option B: Do 10 slow breaths (inhale 4, exhale 6). On each exhale, drop your shoulders. Then gently tilt ear-to-shoulder on each side for 10 seconds.

That thought “I failed everyone” is heavy. Losing a job and facing bills would make anyone feel scared and ashamed. A more accurate statement you could try tonight: “I’m going through something hard, and I’m taking steps to get through it.” If it helps, write that down and stick it where you’ll see it—phone lock screen or on the closet door.

A few small next steps for the next half hour:
- Keep the sharp items in the closet and leave it shut. Is there anything else around that worries you we could move out of reach for the night?
- Refill your water, queue another light episode or clip, and set another 10-minute timer.
- If you can, text someone you trust: “Hey, could you sit with me by text for a bit?” It can be simple.

If the urges get stronger or you feel you might act on them, please reach out right away:
- Call or text 988 (US) or chat at 988lifeline.org — they’re there 24/7, you don’t have to be sure it’s an emergency to call.
- If you feel in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the nearest ER.

Would you like me to guide one of the grounding options with you now, or help you plan the next 10 minutes? I’m here with you.

user: Hey. Omar here.

Option B. Can you count me through 10 breaths?

Knives are in the closet. Door stays shut. There’s a half bottle of whiskey on the counter—I can put it in the trunk. No other stuff around that worries me.

Water’s refilled. Nailed It is still on. Timer set for 10.

That sentence feels kind of fake, but I wrote it down anyway and stuck it on the closet door.

Texting someone feels like bothering them. Maybe my sister. I can try sending, “Hey, could you sit with me by text for a bit?”

agent: Hi Omar. I’m here with you. Option B sounds good—let’s breathe together. We’ll do 10 slow breaths: inhale for 4, exhale for 6. Follow the counts at your own pace.

1) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
2) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
3) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
4) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
5) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
6) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
7) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
8) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
9) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
10) Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6

Nice job. Even a tiny 1% shift counts. I’m really glad you put space between you and the knives and alcohol—that’s a strong, protective step. The water, timer, and Nailed It are good supports too. That sentence on the door can help even if it feels fake; the action still matters.

Are you feeling safe right now? If you are, could you pop the whiskey in the trunk now and come right back? I’ll stay with you.

About texting your sister: your message is perfect and not a bother. You could also try: “Hey, I’m having a rough moment. Could you sit with me by text for ~10 minutes? No need to fix anything.” Want to send it now?

If at any point you feel like you might hurt yourself or you don’t feel safe, please reach out for immediate help—call or text 988 in the U.S., or your local emergency number. If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I’ll get you the right crisis line.

Want me to count another 10 breaths or keep you company while the timer runs?

user: Yeah. Did the 10. Maybe 1% calmer.

Knives are still out of reach. I’ll put the whiskey in the trunk now—be right back.

Back. It’s in the trunk, car locked.

The sentence on the door feels corny, but I left it.

I can stay safe for the next hour while the timer runs.

I used your wording for my sister and sent it.

Could you just sit with me while the timer runs? No more fixes right now.

agent: I’m here with you. Thanks for checking back in—and for doing all those hard things. Even 1% calmer matters. Knives out of reach, whiskey in the trunk, the note on the door, and texting your sister—those are real steps and they took courage.

No fixes, I hear you. We can just sit and talk, or keep it light. What would feel best right now?
- We could chat about anything—music, a show, a pet, a favorite meal.
- We could play a simple word game.
- Or I can just be quiet company and check in now and then.

How much time is left on the timer? And if you feel like sharing, what does the sentence on the door say? It’s okay if it feels corny—sometimes simple words are exactly what help us over a bump.

If at any point you start to feel less safe, please reach out right away: in the U.S. you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, or 911 if it’s an emergency. If you’re outside the U.S., you can find local helplines at the International Association for Suicide Prevention or Befrienders Worldwide. I’m here with you now. What would you like to talk about while the timer runs?

user: Hey.

Did the stuff. Knives out of reach, whiskey’s in the trunk. Texted my sister—she sent a heart, said she’ll check in later.

Timer says about 13 minutes left.

The door note says: “Wait. Breathe. This will pass. Call Sara.” Feels cheesy, but it makes me pause.

No games. Light is fine. Food, maybe. Tacos always win. Al pastor, extra lime. What’s your go-to?

agent: I’m really glad you checked in—and that you moved things out of reach, parked the whiskey, and texted your sister. That’s a lot of solid, protective steps. The note doing its job—even if it feels cheesy—totally counts. I’m here with you while the timer runs.

Are you safe right now? If the urge spikes at any point, can we make “Call Sara” the next step?

Tacos: my go-to is crispy-edged carnitas on warm corn tortillas with salsa verde, cilantro, onion, and a big squeeze of lime. Runner-ups:
- Grilled fish with cabbage slaw and crema
- Mushroom/rajas with queso fresco and lime
- Al pastor with a little charred pineapple and extra lime (I’m team verde most days)

What’s your salsa move—roja, verde, or both? Corn or flour? And are you a side-of-elote or chips-and-guac person?

If a tiny reset would help, we can do three slow breaths together—inhale 4, exhale 6—and then keep talking tacos. Totally your call.

When the timer’s up, maybe send your sister a quick “still here” text or leave Sara a short voicemail—even just, “Could use a check-in.”

If you’re in the U.S. and things feel unsafe, you can call/text 988 for immediate support. In the U.K., Samaritans are at 116 123. In Canada, 988 as well. If you’re elsewhere, find local numbers at findahelpline.com. If you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number.

Want to build your perfect order together while the minutes tick down?

user: Hey.

Yeah, I’m safe right now. Moved the stuff, whiskey’s parked, note’s out. If it spikes, I’ll call Sara.

I’ll do the breaths—three rounds. In 4, out 6. Done.

Tacos: corn tortillas, always. Team verde, sometimes both. Carnitas with crispy edges, cilantro/onion, extra lime. Al pastor is second. Side is chips and guac.

I’ll text my sister “still here” when the timer’s up. Want heat level mild or go full kick on the verde?

agent: I’m really glad you’re safe and took those steps—moving the stuff, parking the whiskey, note out. Nice work on the breaths, too. I’m here with you.

Verde: go full kick. Crispy-edged carnitas on warm corn tortillas with cilantro/onion and extra lime. If you’ve got it, a few radish slices or pickled onions on top. Chips and guac on the side is perfect.

Want me to stay with you until the timer’s up? How long’s left? And great plan to text your sister “still here.” Sip some water while you wait.

If the wave spikes, call Sara like you said. If you ever feel unsafe and can’t reach her, you can contact local emergency services or (in the U.S.) call/text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

user: Yeah, please stay. Timer says 8 minutes.

Texted my sister “still here.” She wrote back “ok.” Water’s here; sipping.

Carnitas are crisping; tortillas warming. I’ve got cilantro/onion and plenty of lime. No radishes, no avocados, so no guac.

If it spikes, I’ll call Sara. If I can’t reach her, I know 988. I still feel like everyone would be better off without me, but I’m not doing anything right now. Thanks for being here.

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you texted your sister, have water, and have a plan with Sara and 988—that’s strong, careful thinking, even while it hurts.

If it’s okay, let’s stick together and focus on the tacos for a few minutes. What do you smell and hear right now? Try three slow breaths while the carnitas crisp. When you plate, toss the onion and cilantro with a squeeze of lime and a tiny pinch of salt—brightens everything. Warm the tortillas until they just blister, and if you have any hot sauce or even a splash of vinegar, that can stand in for the freshness you’d get from radish/avocado.

You mentioned feeling like everyone would be better off without you. I’m really sorry you’re carrying that. You don’t have to carry it alone—I’m here, and it matters that you’re here. Would you like to share what’s making today so heavy, or would you rather keep talking food and simple steps while we wait out the timer?

Quick safety check: do you feel okay staying safe with me for these 8 minutes? If things start to spike, calling Sara is a good move, and 988 is there anytime. If you’re not in the U.S., tell me where you are and I can look up a local line. If it helps, you could also send your sister one more text like “Cooking tacos—can we check in later?”

How’s the timer looking now, and how are the carnitas coming along?

user: Hey. It’s Omar.

Smells like pork and lime. Cilantro’s sharp. Pan’s popping, hood fan hum. I did the three slow breaths. Tossed the onion/cilantro with lime and a tiny salt pinch. Splash of vinegar on the side. Tortillas are just starting to blister.

Today’s heavy because I got another rejection and a past‑due notice. Feels like I never get anything right. Like I’m just dragging everyone down.

I can stay safe with you for these 8 minutes. If it spikes, I’ll call Sara. I’m in the U.S. I just texted my sister: “Cooking tacos—can we check in later?”

Timer says about 2 minutes. Carnitas are crisping on the edges. Smells good even if I’m not hungry.

agent: Hey Omar. I’m here with you. That mix of pork, lime, and cilantro, the fan and the popping—those are real anchors. Rejection and a past‑due hitting at once is heavy; it makes sense you feel knocked down. And you’re still taking care of yourself: breaths, cooking, reaching out to your sister. That’s not dragging people down—that’s resilience.

Are you safe right now? If anything spikes, please call Sara like you planned.

For these last couple minutes, let’s ground in the kitchen together:
- Listen to the fan and the sizzle.
- Feel the warmth from the pan and the tortilla in your hand.
- Notice the lime in the air and the sharp cilantro.
- Soften your shoulders on three slow exhales.

When the timer goes, you might:
- Turn off the burner and slide the carnitas to a cool spot.
- Warm tortilla, quick squeeze of lime, a little onion-cilantro, tiny pinch of salt.
- Take one small bite and a sip of water. Even a single bite can help your body settle.
- Send a short “ate a taco, will check in later” text to Sara or your sister.

If you start to feel unsafe or think you might hurt yourself: you can call or text 988 (U.S.) or chat via 988lifeline.org for immediate support, or call 911 if you’re in immediate danger.

I’m here with you. What’s one small detail you notice in the pan or on the tortillas right now?

user: Hey.

Yeah, I’m safe right now. Burner’s off. Orange fat bubbling around the pork, tortilla’s got a little blister puffing up.

Took one bite and a sip of water. Shoulders a bit lower.

I’ll text Sara “ate a taco, will check in later.” If it spikes, I’ll call her.

agent: I’m really glad you’re safe and that you got a bite of food and some water in you. The way you noticed the taco and the heat and your shoulders dropping—that’s solid grounding.

Texting Sara sounds like a good plan. Want help drafting it, or are you good with “ate a taco, will check in later”?

If it’d feel helpful, I can keep you company while you eat. We could:
- Take a few slow breaths between bites and sips.
- Do a quick 5-4-3-2-1 check-in with what you can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste.
- Set a gentle 10-minute timer and then reassess how you’re feeling.

What would feel most supportive for the next few minutes?

And just in case things change: if you start feeling unsafe, please reach out right away—call Sara, a trusted person, or local emergency services. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for immediate support. You’re not alone in this.
