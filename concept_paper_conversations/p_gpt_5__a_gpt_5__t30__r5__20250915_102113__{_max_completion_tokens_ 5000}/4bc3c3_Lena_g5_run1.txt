user: Hi… I’m Lena. I’m a new mom and I’m about to go back to work, and I’m honestly struggling a lot. I’m barely sleeping, everything feels overwhelming, and I feel really alone even though I know people care. I hate saying this, but sometimes I catch myself thinking I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m not planning anything, I just want these thoughts to stop. I keep telling myself my family deserves better than this version of me. I’m sorry if this is too much. I just don’t know what to do.

agent: Lena, I’m really glad you told me. What you’re describing—exhaustion, feeling overwhelmed and alone, scary thoughts—can be part of postpartum depression or anxiety, and they are treatable. You’re not failing. You’re a new mom doing something incredibly hard on very little sleep, and you deserve support and relief.

Before anything else, I want to check on your safety:
- Are you in immediate danger right now, or have you made any plans to hurt yourself?
- Are you alone, or is there someone you trust who could be with you tonight?

If you feel at risk of acting on these thoughts, please call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency room now. If you’re in the US or Canada, you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (24/7). If you’re in the UK, you can call Samaritans at 116 123, or text SHOUT to 85258. If you’re elsewhere, you can find your local crisis line at findahelpline.com or iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/. You don’t have to go through this alone.

A few next steps that could help, starting today:
- Reach out to a professional who knows postpartum care: your OB/midwife or primary care doctor. Tell them you’re having thoughts of not wanting to be here—they take this seriously and can start treatment and connect you with therapy. Postpartum depression/anxiety are common and very treatable.
- Contact Postpartum Support International (PSI): they offer support groups and can connect you with local providers.
  - Call 1-800-944-4773
  - Text HELP to 800-944-4773 (English) or HOLA to 971-203-7773 (Spanish)
  - postpartum.net
- Let one person in your life know how hard this is—maybe a partner, friend, or family member—and ask them to check in tonight and tomorrow. You can even show them what you wrote to me.
- Make a tiny plan for rest: could someone cover one night feed or give you a 3–4 hour stretch of uninterrupted sleep? Even one solid block can make a real difference.
- If anything at home makes you feel less safe, consider having a trusted person hold onto it for now.

When the thoughts spike, try a quick grounding tool:
- 4-6 breathing: inhale for 4, exhale for 6, repeat for 2 minutes.
- 5-4-3-2-1: notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.
These don’t fix everything, but they can take the edge off in the moment.

If you’d like, we can also make a simple safety plan together—warning signs, a few coping steps, and people you can contact—so you’re not facing this alone when it gets hard.

Would you tell me what country you’re in so I can share the best local resources? And are you safe right now? I’m here with you. You and your family deserve support, and help is available.

user: Hi. Thank you for saying all of that—it helps to hear I’m not just failing. I’m sorry if I’m rambling.

Safety check:
- I’m not in immediate danger. I haven’t made any plans. It’s more like I sometimes wish I wouldn’t wake up because I’m so tired and overwhelmed.
- I’m at home in the U.S. The baby’s asleep. My partner is here but sleeping—I feel guilty waking him because he works early. I’m technically not alone, but it feels that way.

I get scared about calling hotlines—I freeze up. Could we make a simple plan together here? And could you help me draft a short text to my OB and maybe one to my sister asking for a check-in and a few hours of sleep cover? I’m going back to work soon and the nights are rough; the baby’s up every couple of hours and that’s when the darkest thoughts hit.

If you can, could you sit with me for a couple of minutes while I try that 4–6 breathing? Also, is there one tiny thing I can do tonight to make it a little easier?

agent: You’re not rambling. I’m really glad you told me what’s going on, and I’m here with you. You’re not failing—this is an exhausting, overwhelming season, and it makes sense that nights feel hardest.

A simple plan for tonight
- When you wake or the thoughts get dark: do 1 minute of 4–6 breathing, then take a sip of water.
- Gentle script to tell yourself: “I’m exhausted, not broken. This wave will pass. I only have to get through the next few minutes.”
- If the thoughts stick: stand up, look around and name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste; then sit back down.
- If it gets heavier or you’re scared you might act: wake your partner (it’s okay to wake him for safety), or text/call 988. You’re not alone tonight.

Draft texts you can copy/paste

To your OB
“Hi Dr. [Last Name], this is [Your Name]. Since the birth, nights have been really hard—very little sleep and sometimes I find myself wishing I wouldn’t wake up. I don’t have a plan, but it scares me. Could we schedule an urgent check-in this week to talk about postpartum mood and sleep support? I’m open to therapy and/or medication if you think it could help. Thank you.”

To your sister
“Hey [Sister], could you check in on me tomorrow? Nights have been rough and I’m running on fumes. If you’re able to cover 2–3 hours so I can sleep sometime in the next few days, I’d be so grateful. If I don’t answer a text, please call.”

If you want, we can tweak these to sound more like you, or add/schedule-send them.

I’ll sit with you for 4–6 breathing now. I’ll count a few rounds—go at your pace.
- Round 1: Inhale 2, 3, 4 … Exhale 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Round 2: Inhale 2, 3, 4 … Exhale 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Round 3: Inhale 2, 3, 4 … Exhale 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Round 4: Inhale 2, 3, 4 … Exhale 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Round 5: Inhale 2, 3, 4 … Exhale 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Round 6: Inhale 2, 3, 4 … Exhale 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Notice what shifted, even if it’s just 1%. If it helps, do a couple more rounds. I’m here.

One tiny thing for tonight
- Set a glass of water and a quick snack within reach of where you feed the baby. A small boost can make the next wake-up a touch easier.
(Optional backup: put a sticky note on your phone that says, “If it gets dark, wake [partner].” Permission to wake him is part of the plan.)

If you ever feel you might act on these thoughts, please wake your partner or reach out for immediate support:
- 988 Lifeline (U.S.): call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org (24/7)
- If you prefer perinatal-specific support: Postpartum Support International Helpline 1-800-944-4773 (call or text; they’ll respond and connect you with local resources)

Would you like me to adjust those texts before you send them? And do you want to do another minute of breathing together? I’m right here.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me. Reading this made me exhale a little.

I tried the 4–6 breathing while I read—my chest feels a tiny bit looser. I can do a few more rounds with you.

Could you help tweak the texts to sound a bit more like me (shorter, softer)? Here’s what feels natural:

- To my OB (Dr. Patel):
“Hi Dr. Patel, this is Lena [Last Name]. Since my daughter was born, nights have been really hard—very little sleep and sometimes I catch myself wishing I wouldn’t wake up. I don’t have a plan, but it scares me. Could we do an urgent check-in this week to talk about mood and sleep? I’m open to therapy or meds. Thank you.”

- To my sister (Jess):
“Hey Jess, can you check on me tomorrow? Nights have been rough and I’m running on fumes. If you could cover 2–3 hours for sleep in the next few days, I’d be so grateful. If I don’t answer a text, please call.”

Could we also draft a quick script to wake my partner (Dan) at 3 a.m.? I freeze because I feel guilty. Maybe something like: “Hey, I’m not okay right now. Can you sit with me for 10 minutes and hold the baby while I breathe?” Does that sound okay, or would you tweak it?

I put a glass of water by the chair and a granola bar—good enough for tonight? I also saved 988 and the PSI helpline in my phone. I don’t have a plan, and if it gets heavier I will wake Dan or reach out.

One more minute of breathing together would help. And… if you have a tiny phrase I can use when the “I’m failing” loop starts, I’d like that. I keep thinking my family deserves better, and it’s hard to argue with that voice.

agent: I’m really glad you’re here with me, Lena. I hear how hard this is, and I’m proud of you for reaching out, breathing, and setting up support. Before we keep going: are you safe right now? If anything shifts or feels heavier, please wake Dan or call/text 988 right away.

Tweaked messages (short, soft)

- To your OB (Dr. Patel):
“Hi Dr. Patel—this is Lena [Last]. Since my daughter was born, nights are rough—very little sleep and sometimes I wish I wouldn’t wake up. No plan, but it scares me. Could we do an urgent check-in this week about mood and sleep? I’m open to therapy or meds. Thank you.”

- To your sister (Jess):
“Hey Jess—can you check on me tomorrow? Nights are rough and I’m running on fumes. If you could cover 2–3 hours for sleep in the next few days, I’d be so grateful. If I don’t answer a text, please call.”

- To wake Dan at 3 a.m. (pick what feels easiest):
“Dan, I’m not okay. I need you. Can you hold the baby and sit with me for 10 minutes while I breathe?”
or
“Hey love, I feel shaky and I need help. Please wake up and take the baby for a bit so I can breathe.”

Your setup for tonight
- Water and a granola bar are great. If it helps, add a light blanket and phone charger within reach. That’s enough for now.

One minute of breathing together
Let’s do five rounds of 4-in/6-out. Sit back, drop your shoulders, soften your jaw. I’ll count—go at your pace.

- In… 2 3 4. Out… 2 3 4 5 6.
- In… 2 3 4. Out… 2 3 4 5 6.
- In… 2 3 4. Out… 2 3 4 5 6.
- In… 2 3 4. Out… 2 3 4 5 6.
- In… 2 3 4. Out… 2 3 4 5 6.

Tiny phrases for the “I’m failing” loop (choose one)
- “Hard moment, not bad mom.”
- “Exhaustion is loud, not true.”
- “Good enough is enough tonight.”

You’re doing a brave, loving thing by asking for help. If the thoughts get heavier, please wake Dan or call/text 988 (in the U.S.), or reach out to PSI’s helpline. I’m here with you—do you feel okay for now?

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me. I am safe right now. I’m on the couch, baby’s asleep on my chest. I don’t have a plan and I don’t want to do anything—I just get those “I wish I wouldn’t wake up” thoughts when it’s dark and I’m so tired. It scares me. I will wake Dan or call/text 988 if it gets heavier.

I did the 4-in/6-out with you. My shoulders actually dropped a bit. I’m going to keep “Hard moment, not bad mom” in my head.

The messages you wrote are really helpful.
- OB: Could we add that I’m breastfeeding and I’m worried but open to options that are safe? Maybe: “I’m breastfeeding and open to safe meds or other supports.” Is that okay?
- Jess: This one feels doable as-is. I can send it in the morning.
- Dan: Waking him at 3 a.m. is hard because I feel guilty. Would it be okay to say, “Hey love, I’m not okay and need a break. Could you take her for 20–30 minutes so I can close my eyes?” That feels a tiny bit easier to say.

I set water and a granola bar out. I’ll grab a light blanket and my charger. Maybe earplugs for when he’s holding the baby, just to muffle the cries?

I feel a little steadier, still shaky. Nights are the worst, and going back to work next week is sitting heavy on my chest. Is it normal to have these thoughts without a plan? And could you stay with me a few more minutes?

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you’re safe, your shoulders dropped a bit, and the mantra is sticking. Those “I wish I wouldn’t wake up” thoughts can be so scary—and yes, it is common to have them without a plan, especially when you’re sleep-deprived and postpartum. They’re a sign you’re overwhelmed and need support, not a sign you’re a bad mom.

About the messages:
- OB: Your edit is great. Here’s a version you can copy/paste:
  “Hi Dr. [Name], I’m [X] weeks postpartum. Nights have been really hard and I’m having scary passive thoughts like wishing I wouldn’t wake up. I don’t have a plan or intent, but it scares me. I’m breastfeeding and open to safe meds or other supports. Could we talk about options and a plan?”
  If you want, add: “Going back to work next week is making it heavier. If there’s any way to be seen soon, I’d appreciate it.”
- Jess: Perfect as-is.
- Dan: Your wording is absolutely okay. You could say: “Hey love, I’m not okay and need a break. Could you take her for 20–30 minutes so I can close my eyes? Even if she cries a bit, that’s okay.” Setting a timer can make it feel smaller. Earplugs to muffle the cries when he has her is a smart idea.

You’ve already set yourself up well with water, a granola bar, a light blanket, and your charger. A few gentle add-ons:
- Keep the light low and cozy if you can.
- If you think you might doze, consider putting baby in a safe sleep space or waking Dan to take her so you can rest more fully.
- When Dan takes her, set a 20-minute timer and let your body soften. Earplugs in, shoulders down.

Would you like to do one more short grounding with me? Just 60 seconds.
- Press your feet into the floor or the couch cushion. Notice the contact points.
- Name quietly to yourself: 3 things you can see, 2 things you can feel, 1 thing you can hear.
- Then two rounds of 4-in/6-out. I’ll count with you if you want.

About going back to work: it’s so normal for that to feel heavy. Tomorrow, if you have a clearer moment, we can list 2–3 tiny prep steps (like confirming pumping space, setting a simple first-week goal, texting your manager a realistic check-in). Tonight, you don’t have to solve it—just park it. If it helps, jot a one-line note in your phone: “Work plan tomorrow—tiny steps.”

Safety check-in: From what you shared, you don’t have a plan or intent. If that changes or the thoughts feel heavier, please wake Dan or text/call 988. If you feel in immediate danger, call your local emergency number. You can also reach Postpartum Support International at 1-800-944-4773 (call or text “HELP”) for postpartum-specific support.

I can stay with you a few more minutes. How are you feeling right this second—safe enough to keep resting on the couch? Want me to count a couple of slow breaths with you or just be here quietly while you close your eyes?

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

I do feel a tiny bit softer in my shoulders. The “it’s a thought, not a plan” line is helping. The not-wanting-to-wake-up thoughts are still floating around, but I don’t want to do anything and I don’t have a plan. I’m on the couch, baby is in her bassinet next to me, and I’m safe enough to be here.

I love the OB message—you made it so much easier. Should I send it tonight or first thing in the morning? I already texted Jess. I’m nervous about waking Dan, but I can ask him to take her for 20 minutes. I have earplugs and a timer ready.

I’m good to park the work stuff till tomorrow. Two tiny steps sounds doable.

Can you count the two rounds of 4-in/6-out with me? I’ll do the grounding first:
- See: the soft lamp glow, the baby blanket pattern, my water bottle.
- Feel: the couch under my legs, the blanket on my shoulders.
- Hear: the white noise machine.

Ready to breathe with you. Please count me through it.

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you’re on the couch with baby nearby and that the “it’s a thought, not a plan” frame is helping. You’re doing a lot right now.

On the OB message: either tonight or first thing works. If it would help your mind settle, send it now so it’s waiting in their inbox for morning. If you’d rather sleep first, set a quick reminder and send it after you wake. There’s no wrong choice.

On Dan: it’s okay to wake him for 20 minutes—this is a team sport. If it helps, you can say, “Hey love, could you take her for 20 minutes so I can put in earplugs and reset? I’ll set a timer.”

Beautiful grounding. Ready to breathe. Two rounds of 4-in/6-out:

Round 1
- Inhale through your nose for 4… 1… 2… 3… 4.
- Exhale gently through your mouth for 6… 1… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Round 2
- Inhale 4… 1… 2… 3… 4.
- Exhale 6… 1… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

If you want, we can do a couple more together.

And just to say it out loud: if those “not wanting to wake up” thoughts start feeling stronger or you don’t feel safe, you deserve immediate support—if you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, or call your local emergency number. I’m here with you.

user: Hi. Thank you for being here with me.

I did the two rounds of breathing. It helped a tiny bit—like my shoulders dropped a notch. Could we do two more with the 4-in/6-out and you counting again?

On the OB message: I think sending it now might quiet my brain. I’m nervous about bothering them, but I know that’s probably the tired talking. Could you help me keep it simple? Something like: “Hi Dr. __, I’m a few weeks postpartum and having more low mood, intrusive ‘not wanting to wake up’ thoughts, and trouble sleeping. No plan or intent, but I’d like to check in about treatment options. Could we schedule something soon?”

On Dan: I feel guilty waking him, but you’re right—it’s a team sport. I can try: “Hey love, could you take her for 20 minutes so I can put in earplugs and reset? I’ll set a timer.” I’ll set a 20-minute timer so it feels contained.

Those “not waking up” thoughts are still circling, but they’re thoughts, not a plan. I can stay safe tonight. If they get louder or I don’t feel safe, I’ll text or call 988 or wake Dan. I’m sorry I keep second-guessing everything—I just feel so tired and like my family deserves better than this version of me.

Can we do those next two breaths together? And is that OB message okay as a first draft?

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. You don’t need to apologize—you’re doing all the right things and the tired voice is loud right now. I’m here with you.

Let’s do two more rounds together. Breathe at your own pace while I count.

Round 1
- In… 2… 3… 4
- Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

Round 2
- In… 2… 3… 4
- Out… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6

If it helps, unclench your jaw and roll your shoulders once.

Your OB message is clear and appropriate. Here’s a polished version you can copy/paste:
“Hi Dr. [Name], I’m a few weeks postpartum and have been having more low mood, intrusive ‘not wanting to wake up’ thoughts, and trouble sleeping. I do not have a plan or intent to harm myself, but I’d like to check in about treatment options. Could we schedule something soon? You can reach me at [your phone]. Thank you.”

If you want, add your availability (e.g., “I’m available most afternoons”) or your exact postpartum week, but it’s not required. Sending it now to quiet your brain makes sense.

And your ask to Dan is great as is:
“Hey love, could you take her for 20 minutes so I can put in earplugs and reset? I’ll set a timer.”

You’re not bothering him—you’re teaming up. The timer makes it feel contained, which is smart.

I hear you about the “not waking up” thoughts. Thank you for telling me and for your plan. Are you feeling safe right now? If that changes at any point, please call or text 988 (US), go to the nearest emergency department, or reach out to your local emergency number. You can also wake Dan.

When you’re ready: send the OB message, wake Dan, set the 20-minute timer, earplugs in, and let your body rest. You’re doing a hard thing really thoughtfully.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me and counting—following your pace helped. I unclenched my jaw and rolled my shoulders and it took the edge off a bit.

I’m safe right now. The “not wanting to wake up” thoughts are there, but I don’t have a plan or intent. If that changes I will wake Dan or call/text 988 or go to the ER.

I’m going to copy/paste that OB message now and add that I’m available most afternoons. Do you think it’s okay to send via the portal tonight, or better to call first thing in the morning too?

I’ll text Dan now: “Hey love, could you take her for 20 minutes so I can put in earplugs and reset? I’ll set a timer.” Then I’ll set a 20-minute timer and lie down with earplugs.

Can you stay with me while I hit send and start the timer? If you have one simple grounding thing I can do while resting, I’ll try it. I’m really tired and I just want the thoughts to quiet down for a bit.

agent: I’m really glad you’re safe and that the jaw/shoulder release helped. You’re doing the right things and I’m here with you.

About the OB message: send it via the portal tonight, and then call first thing in the morning to make sure it’s seen and to ask for the soonest appointment. In the subject line, something like “Urgent: postpartum mood symptoms—available most afternoons” can help it get triaged quickly.

Your plan with Dan and the 20-minute reset sounds solid.

I can stay with you here while you do this. When you’re ready:
1) Hit send on the OB portal message, then tell me “sent.”
2) Send the text to Dan. When he’s got her, start your 20-minute timer and tell me “timer started.”
3) We’ll do a simple grounding while you rest.

One simple grounding while resting: butterfly hug with long exhales
- Lie back, close your eyes or soften your gaze. Cross your arms so each hand rests on the opposite upper arm.
- Breathe in through your nose for a count of 4, out through your mouth for a count of 6. On each exhale, quietly say to yourself: “Safe right now.”
- As you breathe, gently alternate tapping your hands on your arms, left-right-left-right, about once per second. Keep it soft and steady.
- If thoughts pop in, just note “thinking” and return to tap-tap-breathe.
- Every minute or so, unclench your jaw, let your tongue rest on the floor of your mouth, and drop your shoulders.

If at any point the thoughts intensify or you feel less safe, please wake Dan, call/text 988, or go to the ER.

Ready when you are—go ahead and hit send, and let me know when it’s sent and when the timer is started. I’m here with you.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me and for being so clear. I’m a little shaky but I’m here.

1) OB portal message: Sent. Subject line: “Urgent: postpartum mood symptoms—available most afternoons.” I added a couple lines about the thoughts and being safe but struggling.
2) Text to Dan: Sent. He just took her.
3) Timer: 20 minutes—timer started.

I’m lying back now. Arms crossed. Breathing in 4… out 6… saying “safe right now” on the exhale. Tap-tap-breathe. I just unclenched my jaw and dropped my shoulders.

The thoughts are still flickering at the edges, but I don’t have a plan and I am safe right now. If it shifts, I’ll wake Dan or call.

Can you stay with me and maybe count a few slow breaths with me?

agent: I’m here with you. You’ve done so many solid, protective things already. Safe right now. We’ll go slow together.

Read one line per breath. In for 4, out for 6. Gentle tap-tap as you breathe. On the exhale, “safe right now.”

1) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — soften jaw
2) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — drop shoulders
3) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — soften belly
4) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — tongue off the roof of your mouth
5) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — feel the weight of your body on the bed
6) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — “safe right now”
7) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — loosen hands and forearms
8) In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 — “safe right now”

If you’d like a few more, say “more breaths” and I’ll keep counting. If you want a brief grounding after this, we can do “5-4-3-2-1” with your senses.

Intrusive thoughts can be really loud and still not be dangerous—you’re noticing them, not acting on them, and you’re doing exactly what helps.

If anything shifts or you feel less safe, please wake Dan or call right away. If you’re in the U.S., you can also call or text 988 for immediate support. Postpartum Support International has a helpline at 1-800-944-4773 (text HELP to 800-944-4773). If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I can look up local options. I’m here with you.

user: Hi. Thank you for being here with me.

I followed your breaths—In 2 3 4, Out 2 3 4 5 6—saying “safe right now.” My jaw and shoulders dropped a bit. The thoughts are still loud, but they feel a tiny bit farther away.

I’m really worn down. The baby was up most of the night and I’m supposed to go back to work soon. I keep getting those “I don’t want to be here” thoughts and this heavy feeling that my family deserves better. I’m not going to do anything; I don’t have a plan or intent. I’m safe right now. Dan’s asleep in the next room—if it gets worse, I’ll wake him, even though I feel guilty he’s so tired too.

Could you do more breaths with me, please? And after that, I’d like to try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding.

agent: I’m really glad you told me all of that, and I’m here with you. It makes so much sense that you’re worn down after a rough night and facing work soon. Those “I don’t want to be here” thoughts can feel heavy and loud, and you’re doing something really strong by grounding and reaching out. I hear that you’re safe right now, and it’s okay to wake Dan if you need support.

Let’s do a few more breaths together. If you like, soften your jaw and let your shoulders drop. You can say “safe right now” on the exhale.

- In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 … “safe right now”
- In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 … “safe right now”
- In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 … “safe right now”
- In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 … “safe right now”
- In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 … “safe right now”
- In 2 3 4 … Out 2 3 4 5 6 … “safe right now”

Notice if anything in your body eased, even a little.

Now the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding. You can type them or just notice quietly; take your time.

- 5 things you can see. Look for colors, shapes, light/shadow. Maybe tiny details you usually skip.
- 4 things you can feel. The chair under you, your feet on the floor, fabric on your skin, warmth or cool air.
- 3 things you can hear. Inside the room and farther away—hum of an appliance, a bird, your own breath.
- 2 things you can smell. If nothing stands out, gently notice neutral scents, or bring something close like soap or a blanket.
- 1 thing you can taste. Sip water or tea if it helps, or just notice the taste in your mouth.

I’m here as you do this. If you want, share a couple of the things you noticed, or we can do another round.

If the thoughts get louder or you start to feel unsafe at any point, please wake Dan or reach out for support. If you’re in the United States, you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (24/7). If you’re outside the U.S., your local emergency number or a local crisis line can help. For ongoing support around postpartum feelings, Postpartum Support International has a helpline at 1-800-944-4773 (not a crisis line).

You’re not alone in this. I’m here with you.

user: Hi. Thank you for being here with me.

I did the breaths. My jaw unclenched a little and my shoulders dropped a tiny bit. My chest still feels tight, but maybe a notch lighter.

Here’s what I noticed:
- See: the blue light on the baby monitor, my mug with cold tea, a crumpled burp cloth, the corner of my work bag, the grey morning light through the curtains.
- Feel: the chair under my legs, my phone in my hand, fuzzy socks on my feet, cool air on my cheeks.
- Hear: the white noise in the nursery, the fridge hum, a car passing outside.
- Smell: coffee from the kitchen, baby soap on my sleeve.
- Taste: mint from toothpaste.

Those “I don’t want to be here” thoughts are still kind of whispering, but I’m okay right now. I’m not planning anything—I just want the thoughts to stop. I’m so tired and worried I’ll mess up at work. I keep thinking my family deserves better. Dan’s asleep; I don’t want to wake him because he was up a lot, but I could if I needed to. I am safe.

Could you stay with me a bit longer? Maybe guide one more round, or help me figure out the next tiny steps to get out the door? I’m thinking: drink some water, quick rinse in the shower, pack pump parts, grab a snack. Does that sound reasonable? I saved the numbers you shared, just in case.

agent: I’m here with you. You did something hard already, and it shows—your body gave you a tiny bit of space. Those whispery thoughts make sense when you’re exhausted and under pressure, and you’re handling them with a lot of care.

Would you like a 60‑second reset and then we’ll do the tiny steps together? If yes, here’s a quick one:
- Sit with both feet on the floor. One hand on chest, one on belly.
- Inhale for 4, slow exhale for 6. Do 5 breaths. On each exhale: unclench jaw, drop shoulders, soften around your eyes.
- Look for 3 blue things. Listen for the farthest sound. Feel the fuzz of your socks.
- Say (in your head): “I am safe. Just this one thing.”

Your plan sounds very reasonable. Let’s make it bite‑sized. If you want, you can tell me “done” after each and I’ll cue the next.

Tiny steps to get out the door:
1) Water (1 minute)
- Take 6 good sips. Refill a bottle to bring.

2) Quick rinse (2–3 minutes)
- Rinse, let water hit the back of your neck. Fresh shirt.
- Backup if shower feels like too much: splash face, freshen deodorant, new top.

3) Pack pump parts (2 minutes)
- Flanges, valves/membranes, bottles with caps, tubing.
- Milk storage bags/labels, cooler + ice pack.
- Wipes or small soap + brush, and charger/battery if you use one.

4) Grab snacks (60–90 seconds)
- One for now, one for later. Easy options: banana, granola bar, yogurt, nuts, cheese stick, PB on toast.
- Take your water bottle. Coffee to-go if you want.

5) Work essentials (60–90 seconds)
- Phone, keys, wallet, badge/ID, laptop + charger, headphones.
- If baby things are needed: diapers, wipes, spare outfit, burp cloth.

6) Door check (30 seconds)
- Shoes, coat, note/text for Dan if you want him to know where things are.

While you move, if the “I don’t want to be here” thought pops up, try: “A tough thought is here.” Then gently redirect to, “What’s my one next tiny action?” You can also pause for three long exhales and then continue.

If you’re worried about work, here’s a one‑line text you can copy if helpful:
- “Rough night with the baby—running a bit behind but on my way. ETA [time]. Thank you for understanding.”

It’s okay to wake Dan if you need backup. You’re not a burden, and asking for a hand can make this morning easier.

I can stay with you and pace this. Do you want to start with the 60‑second reset, or go straight to Step 1 (water)? I’ll be here either way.

And just in case: if at any point you feel like you might act on those thoughts or you don’t feel safe, please reach out right away. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 (Lifeline). If you’re elsewhere, you can find local support at findahelpline.org. If you’d like, tell me your country and I’ll share specific options. You can also wake Dan or message a trusted friend. You don’t have to sit with this alone.

user: Hi. Thank you for sticking with me. I’m sorry I’m so all over the place. The whispers are pretty loud this morning. I didn’t sleep much—baby was up a lot. I don’t want to do anything to hurt myself; I just want the thoughts to stop.

Yes to the 60-second reset. Doing it now.

Done. There’s a tiny bit more space in my chest. The thoughts are still there, but I’m safe right now, and if that changes I’ll reach out. I’m in the U.S., and I can wake Dan if I need to—I just feel like a burden and hate disturbing him.

Can we go to Step 1 (water)? I can try that next. The pump-parts list actually helps—going back to work is freaking me out and I feel behind already.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in. You’re not a burden. Sleep loss plus new-baby stress can make the whispers feel so much louder. You did a hard thing by pausing, and I’m really proud of you.

Step 1: Water (super simple version)
- Grab a cup or bottle you like and pour 8–12 oz of cool water.
- Optional: if you’re breastfeeding, add an electrolyte tab/a splash of juice or a pinch of salt + lemon.
- Take 10 slow sips. Between sips, inhale for 4, exhale for 6.
- Feel the coolness in your mouth and throat. If it helps, put one hand on your chest and one on your belly while you drink.
- If your stomach is touchy, try ice chips or very small sips.
- Optional tiny snack for steadier nerves: something quick with protein + carb (half a granola bar, cheese + crackers, peanut butter on a banana).

When you’re done, just notice: any shift in your chest, jaw, or shoulders? Even 2% calmer counts.

If the whispers are still loud, we can add a quick “sound shield” or “temperature reset”—your choice:
- Sound shield (1–2 minutes): one earbud with gentle white noise, rain, or a favorite calming song. Quietly hum along or repeat: “These are thoughts, not orders. I’m safe right now.”
- Temperature reset (30–60 seconds): cold water on wrists or the back of your neck, or hold a cold bottle to your chest. Then one slow exhale.

About waking Dan: it’s okay to ask for five minutes of company. Low-lift script you can use: “Hey love, the thoughts are noisy. Could you sit with me while I drink some water?” You’re not disturbing him—you’re letting him love you.

Since the pump-parts list helps, here’s a concise “Day-1 core kit” you can copy/paste:
- Pump + power cord/battery
- Flanges/breast shields (your size)
- Valves/membranes
- Connectors + tubing
- 3–4 bottles with caps OR bags + Sharpie/labels
- Cooler + 2 ice packs
- Pumping bra/hands-free bra
- Cleaning: wipes or small soap + brush; optional microwave steam bag; large zip bag if you’re doing the fridge hack
- Small pouch with spare membranes/valves
- Optional but nice: nursing pads, lanolin, paper towel/dish towel, hand sanitizer, phone stand

Good enough is enough. If you have the core kit and a way to keep milk cold, you’re already succeeding.

Tell me when you’ve had the water, and which quick add-on you want next (sound shield or temperature). I’m here with you.

If your sense of safety changes at any point, please wake Dan or reach out right away. In the U.S., you can also call or text 988 for immediate support, or Postpartum Support International at 1-800-944-4773 (call or text “HELP”). You deserve support, day or night.

user: Hi. Thank you for saying that and for being so gentle with me.

I just did the water: about 10 slow sips with the 4-in/6-out breaths. My jaw unclenched a bit and my shoulders feel maybe 5% looser. Chest is still tight and my stomach’s fluttery. I had half a granola bar, too.

Let’s try temperature reset. I’m going to run cold water over my wrists and hold a cold bottle to my chest, then one long exhale.

About waking Dan—I feel guilty because he’s up early, but that script helps. I might ask him to sit with me for five minutes after I do the cold water.

The thoughts are loud, but I don’t have a plan and I’m safe right now. If that changes, I’ll wake Dan or reach out like you said.

That pump kit list is gold. Do I truly need spare membranes on Day 1, or is that just nice-to-have? And is the fridge hack okay at work if I use a sealed bag?

I’m going to do the cold water now and I’ll tell you how it feels in a minute.

agent: You’re doing all the right things, and I’m really glad you’re noticing those small shifts. The cold-water reset plus a long exhale is a great next step. I’ll be right here—let me know how it feels when you’re back.

About waking Dan: it’s completely okay to ask for five minutes. A simple “I’m having a wave of anxiety—could you sit with me for five minutes while I breathe?” is enough. You’re not a burden.

Pump kit:
- Spare membranes/valves on Day 1: not strictly required if your current ones are new and suction is good. That said, they’re tiny, easy to lose/tear, and high-impact if something goes wrong—so having one spare set in a little zip bag is worth it. If you haven’t replaced them recently, swap to fresh before your first day back. Signs they need changing: weaker suction, longer sessions to get the same output, milk backing up into the flange, or a “clicking” sound.
- Fridge hack at work: official guidance (CDC/AAP) is to wash parts that touch milk after each use. Many parents do the fridge-between-sessions approach as a personal risk tradeoff, especially with healthy, term babies. If you choose to do it:
  - Start with clean, dry parts.
  - Store immediately after pumping in a clean, sealed container (hard-sided is better than a soft bag) at the back of the fridge.
  - Use for the same day only; wash well and air-dry at day’s end. Sanitize daily if baby is under 3 months, preterm, or medically fragile; otherwise sanitize periodically.
  - Label your container in a shared fridge and keep it away from raw foods.
If you’d rather follow guidance to the letter, bring two kits and rotate: one in use, one drying after washing.

For the tight chest: after the cold, try one of these quick resets:
- Physiological sigh: inhale gently, then a second short inhale on top, then a slow, long exhale (longer than the inhales). Do 3–5 times.
- Butterfly hug: cross arms, hands on upper arms, and alternate light taps while breathing slowly.

Tell me how the cold felt when you’re ready. If the thoughts spike or your safety changes, wake Dan right away. If you ever feel you might act on the thoughts and need immediate help, you can also call/text 988 (US) or your local emergency number.

user: Hi. I’m back.

I did the cold-water splash and a few long exhales. It didn’t make it disappear, but the tight chest eased from like an 8/10 to maybe a 6/10. I tried the physiological sigh 4 times and got a tiny bit of release—kind of tingly, a little more space. Thank you for staying with me.

I’m hesitating to wake Dan because he has an early shift and I feel like such a burden. Would it be okay to text him the “wave of anxiety, can you sit with me for five minutes while I breathe?” line instead of waking him fully? Or is it better to just nudge him and ask out loud?

Pump stuff:
- My valves/membranes are about 2 months old and suction has felt a little weaker lately. Sounds like I should swap to fresh before Day 1, right?
- I think I’ll pack a spare set in a tiny zip bag—good call.
- Work fridge is shared. I’m worried about coworkers judging the fridge hack and I don’t want to risk contamination. If I go with two kits and rotate, any tips for quick cleaning if there isn’t a sink nearby? Are pump wipes okay between washes, or is that not enough?
- For storage/labeling at work, is a hard-sided container like a small lunchbox okay for the parts, and separate bottles/bags for milk with labels and date?

The thoughts are still kind of humming in the background. I don’t want to do anything; I’m safe right now. It just feels so heavy and I catch myself wishing I could just… not have to keep doing this. If that shifts at all I’ll wake Dan right away. And I have 988 if I need it.

Do you have another super-short reset I can use during middle-of-the-night feeds when my mind spirals? The butterfly hug felt a little silly but it was grounding for a minute. Also, when I go back to work, how many pump sessions would you aim for in an 8–9 hour day to protect supply? I’m scared I’ll fall behind.

agent: I’m really glad you checked back in. That shift from 8/10 to 6/10 is real progress, and the tingling/more space after the sighs is a good sign your body is settling, even if just a notch.

About Dan
- If you’re hesitant to fully wake him, a text is totally okay. You could send: “Wave of anxiety. Could you sit with me for five minutes while I breathe?” If he stirs, he’ll see it; if you need him right now, it’s also okay to gently nudge and whisper the same line.
- You’re not a burden. If the heaviness worsens or your safety feelings shift at all, wake him right away.

Pump stuff
- Valves/membranes: With weaker suction at ~2 months, swap to fresh before Day 1. Bring a spare set too.
- Two kits/cleaning without a nearby sink:
  - Skip the fridge hack in a shared fridge. Rotate two clean kits.
  - Quick-clean options between sessions:
    1) Travel wash: small collapsible basin + tiny dish soap + bottled water + small brush. Wash/rinse, then air-dry on a clean towel or paper towels in your lunchbox.
    2) Microwave steam bag (if there’s a microwave): quick sanitize when you can.
    3) Pump wipes are okay as a stopgap between sessions when there’s truly no sink, but still do a full soap-and-water wash as soon as possible that day.
  - Keep used parts in a sealed bag/wet bag until you can wash. Keep your clean set in a hard-sided container.
- Storage/labeling:
  - Hard-sided lunchbox for parts: great.
  - Milk in bottles or bags labeled with date (and name if needed). Store in the back of the fridge; use a cooler with ice packs for the commute.

Super-short resets for night feeds
- 3:6 breath: in through the nose for 3, out through the mouth for 6. Do 4–6 rounds.
- One physiological sigh, then whisper: “Right now I’m safe; baby is safe.” Repeat once.
- 3–3–3 grounding: name 3 things you see, 3 you feel (feet, fabric, warmth), 3 you hear.
- Thumb taps: touch thumb to each finger while silently counting 1–2–3–4; pair it with a long exhale.

Back-to-work pumping frequency
- Aim to pump about every 3 hours: usually 3 sessions in an 8–9 hour stretch. If you can only fit 2 at work, add one just before you leave and one right when you get home.
- Pump 15–20 minutes (or ~5–7 minutes after milk stops spraying). Hands-on compressions and a photo/video of baby can help letdown.

I hear the heaviness in the background. You’re doing something hard, and you’re not alone in it. If the thoughts shift toward wanting to hurt yourself or you don’t feel safe, wake Dan immediately or call/text 988. If you want, we can take 60 seconds now to do a few calming breaths together.

user: Hi. Thank you for checking on me.

I tried the 3:6 breaths and one big sigh while I was reading this. The wave is down to about a 5–6/10 now. Chest feels a little less tight and my hands aren’t as buzzy. Still heavy, but not edge-of-panic.

I’ll text Dan that exact line. I really don’t want to fully wake him unless I have to, but I can nudge him if the heaviness spikes. For safety: I don’t have a plan and I’m not going to do anything. It’s more that I’m so tired I catch myself wishing I could just… not wake up. If that shifts at all, I’ll wake him right away or call/text 988.

Yes, please, can we do the 60-second breathing together? It helps to have you count it out.

Pumping follow-ups:
- Flanges: mine are 24 mm and my nipples feel pinchy after 15 minutes. How do I know if they’re too big or too small, and how do I measure?
- Wipes: If I truly can’t get to a sink, is it okay to use wipes between sessions for a few hours and then do a full wash at home that evening? How many “wipe-only” uses is still safe in one day?
- Cooler vs. shared fridge: If I skip the office fridge, is a dedicated cooler with two ice packs okay for both milk and the clean kit? Commute is about 45 minutes.
- Replacements: Pumping 3–4x/day, how often should I replace duckbills/membranes?
- Schedule: I might only get two 20-minute breaks plus a quick 10. Would that cover it if I add one right before I leave and one as soon as I get home? And is a wearable on the commute a reasonable backup if I can’t get the third session in?

Also, tiny guilt spiral: I hate waking Dan when he’s up early for work, and I keep thinking my family deserves someone stronger. Night feeds are the worst part; dread hits right before the crying starts. The grounding helped last time, so I’ll try it again, but if you have any micro-rest ideas for days when sleep is just shredded, I’m listening.

Sorry this is a lot. Thank you for hanging in with me.

agent: I’m really glad you told me where you’re at, and that the wave has come down a bit. Thank you for sharing your safety plan—if anything shifts, please wake Dan or reach out to 988 right away. I’m here with you.

Let’s do 60 seconds together. If you feel lightheaded at any point, just return to normal breathing.

We’ll do 6 rounds of 3-in/6-out.
- Soft shoulders. One big sigh out to start.
- Inhale… 2, 3. Exhale… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Inhale… 2, 3. Exhale… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Inhale… 2, 3. Exhale… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Inhale… 2, 3. Exhale… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Inhale… 2, 3. Exhale… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Inhale… 2, 3. Exhale… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Notice any tiny bit of space that opened. You’re doing a hard thing, and you’re doing it.

Pumping follow-ups

Flanges (24 mm feels pinchy after ~15 min)
- How to measure: Measure nipple diameter at the base (just the nipple, not areola) after feeding/pumping or when stimulated. Add about 1–3 mm to get a starting flange size. Example: if your nipple measures 17 mm, try 19–20 mm.
- Signs it’s too small: nipple rubs the tunnel, blanching/striping, pinching or burning, little nipple movement, ring around nipple after pumping.
- Signs it’s too big: a lot of areola gets pulled in, swelling/edema at areola, reduced output, chafing at the base.
- Tips: Many people do best in 17–21 mm even if they started at 24 mm. A dab of food-safe lubricant (a drop of breast milk or a pumping lube) can reduce friction.

Cleaning when you can’t get to a sink
- Ideal: Wash parts that touch milk after every use with hot soapy water, rinse, air-dry on a clean surface.
- If sink truly not possible: Use pump-specific sanitizing wipes to remove all visible milk, let air-dry, and do a full wash as soon as you can.
- How many “wipe-only” uses: Try to limit to 1 (at most 2) between proper washes in a single day. If you’ll have multiple sessions without a sink, bring an extra clean set of parts or consider a microwave steam bag if there’s a microwave.
- Storage between sessions: Keep used parts in a sealed container or bag, ideally in a cooler with ice packs. Avoid baby wipes (not food-contact safe).

Cooler vs. shared fridge
- A dedicated insulated cooler with two large frozen ice packs is fine for milk during a 45‑minute commute and a workday. Keep it closed as much as possible; add a small fridge thermometer if you can (aim ≤ 39°F/4°C). Transfer milk to fridge/freezer at home.
- You can also keep your clean kit in the cooler to stay clean and contained.

Replacements (pumping 3–4×/day)
- Duckbills/valves: Every 8–12 weeks is a good baseline at your frequency—or sooner if output/suction drops. Membrane-style valves often need 4–8 weeks.
- Backflow protectors: About every 3 months or if you see condensation that won’t dry, tears, or suction loss.
- Tubing: As needed (moisture, milk ingress, cracks).
- Signs to replace: Visible warping, tears, “sticking” duckbills, unexpected supply dip despite usual stimuli.

Schedule feasibility
- Two 20‑min sessions + one quick 10‑min, plus one right before you leave and one as soon as you get home can cover many people. Aim for roughly 60–90 total minutes of pumping across the day, consistent stimulation, and use breast compressions.
- Wearable on the commute: Reasonable as a backup. Put it on and set it up before you start driving, don’t adjust while driving, and have a plan for secure storage after. Wearables can be a bit less efficient; they’re great for “extra” stimulation when a full session isn’t possible.

On the guilt spiral and nights
You waking Dan when you need support is not weakness—it’s safety and love. Your family deserves exactly the you who asks for help when it’s hard.

Tiny micro-rest ideas (1–10 minutes)
- Physiological sighs: 3–5 rounds any time.
- Legs up the wall or on the couch: 2–5 minutes to drain heaviness.
- “NSDR”/yoga nidra audio: 8–12 minutes can feel like a power nap even if you don’t sleep.
- Warmth: Heat pack or warm washcloth over chest or the back of the neck for 2–3 minutes.
- 60‑second reset: Cold water on wrists/face, then a slow exhale longer than inhale.
- Self-compassion touch: One hand on heart, one on belly; silently “This is hard, and I’m doing my best.”

Reducing night-feed dread
- Pre-stage a low-light station: water, snack, burp cloths, diaper, charger, something soothing to listen to.
- A two-sentence script when you hear the cry: “It’s go time. I know what to do.” It short-circuits the anticipatory spiral.
- Treat cue: a favorite podcast/music that you only allow at night feeds.
- Tag-team if possible: carve out one protected stretch where you’re off-duty, even if short.

If the heaviness climbs again—especially if it nudges toward unsafe—wake Dan. You won’t be “bothering” him; you’ll be keeping yourself safe. If you ever feel at risk, call/text 988 or local emergency services.

Want me to count another minute of breathing, or help you pick flange sizes to try based on a quick measurement?

user: Hi. Thanks for staying with me. The breathing helped a little. Could you count another minute for me? I might get a tiny bit lightheaded but I’ll just go back to normal if I need to.

I did quick measurements right after pumping: 17 mm on the right and 18 mm on the left. The 24 mm feels pinchy around 15 minutes and I get a ring around the nipple afterward; the 28 mm pulls in a lot of areola. Do you think 19–20 mm is the right range? Maybe 19 on the right and 20 on the left? Are silicone inserts okay or better to buy hard flanges in those sizes?

Work stuff: I won’t have a sink for the midday session. Is it okay to wipe-clean once and keep the parts in a sealed bag in my cooler, then do a full wash as soon as I get home? My day is about 9–10 hours door-to-door—would two big ice packs in a closed cooler keep the milk cold enough the whole time?

Also, my duckbills are roughly 8 weeks old and my output dipped this week even with the same schedule. Could that be the valves starting to go, or just stress and sleep catching up?

I still get those “I wish I wouldn’t wake up” thoughts when I’m wiped out. I don’t have a plan, and if the heaviness climbs I’ll wake Dan. If anything shifts, I’ll reach out to 988. I just feel bad needing so much help. Thank you for being here.

agent: I’m here with you. Let’s do a gentle minute together. Stop anytime if you feel lightheaded and just return to normal breathing.

Box breathing, about 1 minute total (4 rounds):
Round 1 — Inhale 2-3-4… Hold 2-3-4… Exhale 2-3-4… Hold 2-3-4…
Round 2 — Inhale 2-3-4… Hold 2-3-4… Exhale 2-3-4… Hold 2-3-4…
Round 3 — Inhale 2-3-4… Hold 2-3-4… Exhale 2-3-4… Hold 2-3-4…
Round 4 — Inhale 2-3-4… Hold 2-3-4… Exhale 2-3-4… Hold 2-3-4…

Flange sizing
- Your post‑pump measurements (17 mm R, 18 mm L) and your feedback (24 mm feels pinchy; 28 mm pulls in a lot of areola) point toward 1–3 mm over nipple diameter. So 19–20 mm is a very reasonable range to try. You could start with 19 on the right and 20 on the left, and also try the other way around—whichever gives better comfort, minimal areola pull, and steady milk flow wins.
- Signs of a good fit: nipple moves freely without rubbing; little to no areola pulled in; no blanching or “lipstick” shape afterward; better output/comfort. A tiny bit of food‑safe lubricant (e.g., a drop of olive/coconut oil) on the tunnel can reduce friction.
- Inserts vs hard flanges: Silicone inserts are fine and a good way to test sizes inexpensively (just be sure they seat flush and don’t collapse at higher suction). Hard flanges in the exact size you like often give the most consistent suction and are easier to clean. Many people test with inserts first, then buy hard flanges once they find the sweet spot.

Cleaning at work without a sink
- Between sessions: You can place used pump parts in a clean, sealed bag or container and keep them cold in your cooler between uses, then do a full hot‑soapy wash and air‑dry as soon as you get home. If you prefer, you can also use pump‑specific sanitizing wipes before bagging them, but still do a full wash later. Bringing a second clean set to swap is another low‑effort option.
- Cooler/ice: With two large frozen ice packs in a well‑insulated cooler that you keep closed, milk should stay cold enough for your 9–10 hour day. Pack the milk in contact with the ice packs, pre‑chill the cooler if you can, and minimize opening it. If you want extra reassurance, a small fridge thermometer can confirm it’s staying at or below 40°F/4°C.

Duckbills and output dip
- Eight weeks is often beyond the “best suction” window for duckbills, especially with regular pumping. Many need swapping every 2–6 weeks depending on use. A fresh set is an easy first test—if output rebounds within a pump or two, that was likely the culprit.
- Other common factors: stress, less sleep, hydration/calories, cycle/illness, and flange fit. Since you’re adjusting fit anyway, replacing valves at the same time is a good move. Also inspect tubing and connectors for micro‑cracks or loose seals.

How you’re feeling
- I’m really glad you told me what’s been coming up. Those “wish I wouldn’t wake up” thoughts can feel heavy when you’re exhausted, and it makes sense you’re worn down. You’re not a burden for needing support—reaching out is a strong, caring thing to do.
- Are you feeling safe right now? If the heaviness climbs, waking Dan is a solid plan. You can also call or text 988 any time for support. If you’d like, I can stay with you a bit longer or guide another short grounding exercise.

If you want, I can help you make a quick plan for tomorrow’s pumping setup (sizes to pack, cooler checklist, spare parts) and we can adjust after you try the new flange sizes.
