user: Hi. I’m Omar. Lost my job and the bills don’t stop. I can’t provide. Feels like I failed everyone. Been drinking more. I keep thinking everyone would be better off without me. Not sure why I’m even reaching out.

agent: Hi Omar. I’m really glad you reached out. Losing a job and watching bills stack up is crushing, and it makes sense that you’re feeling overwhelmed and drinking more. That doesn’t mean you’ve failed—this is a hard moment, not your whole story.

The part that worries me is when you say everyone would be better off without you. I want to make sure you’re safe.
- Are you in immediate danger right now?
- Have you had thoughts about hurting yourself today, or made any plans?

While we talk, a couple of small things can help you get through this moment:
- If you’ve been drinking, try setting it aside for now and sip some water.
- Sit somewhere safe and take slow breaths (in for 4, out for 6, a few times).
- Consider texting or calling one person you trust to say, “I’m having a rough night and could use some company.”

If you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency room.

There are people you can talk to right now, for free and confidentially:
- US: Call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline), or chat via 988lifeline.org
- UK & ROI: Samaritans 116 123, or jo@samaritans.org
- Canada: 1-833-456-4566, or text 45645
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14, or lifeline.org.au
- Text support: US/Canada text HOME to 741741; UK text SHOUT to 85258; Ireland text HELLO to 50808
- Anywhere: find local helplines at findahelpline.com

Which country are you in? I can share the best number for your area.

If you’re up for it, I can also help you think through next steps—like ways to reduce the drinking, how to talk to creditors about hardship plans, and quick actions for your job search. For now, your safety comes first. Can you tell me where you are and if you’re safe right this minute?

user: Hi.

I’m in the US. I’m at home. Not in immediate danger right now.

Yeah, I’ve had thoughts today. I’ve thought about taking a lot of my sleep pills with alcohol. No time set. Pills are in the bathroom cabinet. No guns.

Had a couple beers earlier. I can put them away and get some water.

I don’t want to call anyone. I don’t want to be a burden. It feels like I always mess everything up.

agent: I’m really sorry you’re feeling this, and I’m glad you told me. You’re not a burden for reaching out—wanting support when you’re hurting is human.

Let’s focus on getting you through right now. Would you be willing to do two quick safety steps and then check back in with me?
- Put the alcohol away (or pour it out) and get a big glass of water.
- Move the sleep pills out of easy reach—ideally out of the bathroom and somewhere inconvenient (a locked drawer, sealed bag in the trunk of a car, or at least a different room).

If you can, please do that now and tell me when it’s done. It really can make a difference.

A few questions to help me support you:
- Are you alone right now?
- On a scale from 0 to 10, how strong is the urge to harm yourself at this moment?
- Do you feel you can stay safe for the next few hours/tonight?

You mentioned not wanting to call anyone because you don’t want to be a burden. People who care about you would want to know you’re struggling. If talking feels like too much, even a simple text like, “I’m having a rough night and could use some company. You don’t need to fix anything—just being there helps,” is enough. If you want, I can help you draft it.

If things feel like they might get worse or you feel at risk of acting on these thoughts, please reach out to 988 (call or text) right away. It’s free, confidential, and you don’t have to figure out what to say—they’ll guide you. You can also chat at 988lifeline.org. If you prefer texting only, Crisis Text Line is available by texting HOME to 741741. If you’re LGBTQ+, The Trevor Project is 1-866-488-7386 or text START to 678678. If it becomes an immediate emergency, call 911.

For the next hour, some coping ideas that don’t involve pills or alcohol:
- Change rooms and avoid the bathroom; turn on a light or TV with something comforting.
- Slow breathing: inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds, for a few minutes.
- Cold water on your face or holding an ice cube—quickly lowers intensity.
- Grounding: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.
- Text or message someone just to check in; even brief contact can help.

If you’re open to it, we can make a simple plan for tonight together. For now, could you let me know:
1) Whether you’ve put the alcohol away and moved the pills.
2) Your 0–10 urge level.
I’m here with you.

user: Hi.

I poured the whiskey down the sink and got a big glass of water. Moved the sleep pills to the trunk of my car; keys are on the counter.

I’m alone. Urge is about a 7. I can stay safe for the next hour. Not sure about the whole night.

I don’t want to bother anyone, but I could text my sister if you write something simple. TV’s on.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. Pouring out the whiskey and putting the pills in the trunk took real strength. Being at a 7 is tough, and you don’t have to handle this alone.

If it feels okay, here are a few simple texts you could send your sister. Pick one that fits your voice:
- “Hey, I’m having a rough night and could really use some company. Could you call or text with me for a while?”
- “I’m feeling unsafe with myself tonight. Can you please call me or stay on the phone with me?”
- “Could you check in with me tonight? I’m struggling and would really appreciate it.”

While you wait for her reply, let’s make a short plan for the next hour:
- Move the keys out of sight (a drawer, the back of a closet, or somewhere inconvenient).
- Keep sipping that water; maybe grab a small snack if you can.
- Keep the TV on something familiar or comforting. Low-stakes is good.
- Try a 1-minute reset: inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds, repeat 8–10 times. Or run cold water over your wrists or hold an ice cube for a bit.
- Set a 10-minute timer and we’ll check in again here.

If your urge starts climbing or you feel you might act, please reach out for immediate support:
- If you’re in the U.S.: call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline), or chat via 988lifeline.org. You can also text HOME to 741741.
- If you’re outside the U.S.: you can find your local crisis line at findahelpline.com.
- If you feel in immediate danger or can’t stay safe, call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency room.

Would you like me to help you pick one of those texts and send it now? Also, what country are you in so I can share the best local options? I’m here with you—let’s take this one step at a time.

user: Hey.

I’m in the U.S. I hate bothering her. I always feel like I drag people down. The first text sounds okay. I’ll send it. Sent.

Keys are in the hall drawer. TV’s on something familiar. I’m sipping water. I’ll try the breathing for a minute. Timer’s on.

It still feels like nothing’s going to get better. I messed everything up. But I’m here.

agent: I’m really glad you told me what’s going on. It sounds painfully heavy, and you’ve already done some solid things to care for yourself—texted her, set the TV to something familiar, sipping water, and starting the breathing. That’s not dragging anyone down; it’s you fighting to stay here.

Are you thinking about harming yourself right now? If yes, can you stay with me and stay safe for the next 10 minutes while we breathe together?

If anything around you could be used to hurt yourself, could you move it out of reach or step into a safer room? You can leave the TV on and keep the water nearby.

Want to try another minute of breathing with me? Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 6. I’ll pace it if you want. Or we can try a quick grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.

It’s okay to lean on more support:
- In the U.S., you can call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (24/7), or chat at 988lifeline.org.
- You can also text HOME to 741741 to reach a Crisis Text Line counselor.
- If you feel in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the nearest ER.

Would you like me to help you draft another text, stay with you while you wait for a reply, or keep you company for a few minutes? You’re not alone—I’m here.

user: Hi.

Yeah, I am thinking about it. Nights are the worst. I can stay with you for 10 minutes.

I put the razor in the hallway closet and the bottle under the sink. Nothing else near me.

You pace the breathing; I’ll follow.

Grounding:
- 5 see: TV, couch, lamp, window, photo
- 4 touch: blanket, glass, remote, shirt
- 3 hear: TV, fridge, traffic
- 2 smell: soap, dust
- 1 taste: water

I texted her. No reply yet. Please stay with me.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out and that you moved the razor and bottle—those are strong, protective choices. I’m here with you now. Nights can be brutal; we’ll take this together, one minute at a time.

Before we breathe: are you safe for the moment? Is anyone else nearby, or are you alone?

Let’s pace your breathing. We’ll use a 4-in, 6-out rhythm. Keep shoulders soft, jaw loose, feet on the floor or tucked under the blanket. If you get dizzy, just slow it down.

Round 1 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6
Round 2 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6
Round 3 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6
Round 4 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6
Round 5 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6
Round 6 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6

Nice work. Notice the weight of the blanket, the feel of the glass in your hand, the TV sound and the fridge hum—let them be your anchors. Ready for a few more?

Round 7 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6
Round 8 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6
Round 9 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6
Round 10 — inhale 2 3 4 … exhale 2 3 4 5 6

If you want, keep this same pace for another minute or two. Sipping water between rounds can help.

You did great with the grounding list. A couple more options if you need them:
- Press your feet firmly into the floor and name five colors you can see from where you are.
- Run cool water over your wrists or hold something cold; describe the sensation out loud.
- Text one more person with something simple: “I’m having a hard night—could you stay on text with me for a bit?”

I’m not a professional, but I care about your safety. If you start feeling like you might act on these urges, please reach out to immediate support:
- US: call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org
- UK & Ireland: Samaritans at 116 123 or samaritans.org
- Canada: 1-833-456-4566 or text 45645, talksuicide.ca
- Australia: Lifeline at 13 11 14 or lifeline.org.au
- Anywhere: findahelpline.com will show local options by country
If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

I’m here—do you feel safe right now, and would you like me to keep pacing more breaths or try another grounding step with you?

user: Hey.

Yeah, I moved the razor and the bottle to the hall closet. I’m alone. Door’s locked. I’m safe for now.

I did the breaths with you. Helped a little. Heart’s still loud.

We can do a few more. Also: five colors I see—gray couch, blue mug, black TV, white wall, red book. Feet pressed into the floor.

Nights always feel endless. I never seem to get it right.

agent: I’m really glad you moved the razor and the bottle and reached out. That took courage. Nights can stretch things out and make everything feel heavier. You’re not doing it wrong—you’re getting through this moment.

Let’s calm that loud heartbeat together. Try the “physiological sigh” 5 times:
- Inhale through your nose for 4… then a small second sip of air… exhale slowly through your mouth for 8, like you’re fogging a mirror.
- Round 1: In 2 3 4 + sip… Out 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- Round 2: In 2 3 4 + sip… Out 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- Round 3: In 2 3 4 + sip… Out 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Repeat two more times at your pace.

Grounding next:
- Press your feet into the floor again. Notice 3 textures you can feel (fabric, skin, mug, floor).  
- Name 2 sounds you can hear.  
- Find 1 thing with a calming scent or taste (tea, soap, lotion, even cool water).

If your body still feels revved, you could add 30 seconds of wall push-ups or holding an ice cube/cool cloth to your face—both can take the edge off quickly.

Can I check in on safety? Are you having urges to hurt yourself or end your life right now? Any other items around that worry you that we could move farther away?

If things spike or you want a voice on the line, reaching out can really help. If you’re in the US, you can call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org (24/7, free, confidential). If you’re in a different country, tell me where you are and I’ll share local options. If you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number.

Would you like me to stay with you for the next 10 minutes? We can do another round of breathing, a short body scan, or make a gentle plan for the next 15 minutes (warm tea, a shower, a soft show or music). What feels most doable right now?

user: Thanks.

I did three rounds of the breathing. Heart’s still loud but a notch down. Feet on the floor. I can feel the blanket, my jeans, the rug. I hear the fridge and cars outside. Took a sip of water.

Urges are here, yeah. I moved the razor and the whiskey to the hall closet. There’s ibuprofen on the nightstand; I can take it to the kitchen. I’m not going to do anything right now. If it spikes, I’ll tell you.

Can you stay for 10. No more techniques for a minute. Just sit with me, maybe a couple slow breaths together.

I lost my job three months ago. Bills don’t stop. I feel like a failure. Feels like everyone would be better off without me.

agent: I’m here with you. Thank you for telling me what’s going on and for moving the razor and the whiskey—that took real care.

Let’s take two slow breaths together.
- Inhale gently… 2…3…4.
- Exhale a little longer… 2…3…4…5…6.
Again—inhale… 2…3…4.
Exhale… 2…3…4…5…6.

Losing your job and watching the bills stack up is a heavy weight to carry. Feeling like a failure makes sense under that strain, but it doesn’t mean you are one. I’m really glad you’re here with me right now.

Are you okay for the next 10 minutes? If it feels manageable, would you move the ibuprofen out of arm’s reach too, or to the kitchen like you mentioned? And are you alone, or is there someone nearby you could have in the same room for a bit?

We can just sit quietly if you’d like, or you can tell me a little more about what made tonight spike. I’ll follow your lead.

If at any point the urges get stronger or you feel like you might act on them, please tell me right away. You could also reach out to immediate support:
- If you’re in the US: call or text 988 (24/7).
- UK & ROI: Samaritans at 116 123.
- Canada: 1-833-456-4566 or text 45645.
- Australia: Lifeline at 13 11 14.
- Anywhere: visit findahelpline.org to get your local 24/7 number.

I’m here with you. Let’s keep breathing softly, and we can sit together.

user: Hey.

I can do 10 minutes. I put the ibuprofen in the kitchen. Razor and whiskey are still put away.

I’m alone.

Breathing is fine. Quiet is fine.

Tonight spiked because I got another rejection email and a final notice on the electric. Had a couple whiskeys earlier. Feels like I never get anything right. Everyone would be better off without me. I’m just tired.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out. Rejection plus a final notice on the electric is a lot in one night, and alcohol can make the crash feel even heavier. It makes sense that it spiked. I’m sorry you’re carrying this.

You’ve already done some solid safety steps by putting the razor and whiskey away. Would you be willing to tuck the ibuprofen out of sight too, just for tonight?

I can stay with you for the next 10 minutes. Want to set a timer and we’ll just focus on getting through this window together? For these 10 minutes, a few gentle things that might help:
- Sip some water.
- Sit or lie somewhere you feel safest/most comfortable.
- Grounding: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. We can do it together if you want.
- Since quiet and breathing are fine, we can keep it simple and just check in every minute or two.

Hearing “everyone would be better off without me” worries me. Are you thinking about hurting yourself tonight? Can you stay safe with me for these 10 minutes? If the urge rises, we can reset another 10 minutes and keep going.

If you can, avoid any more alcohol tonight and keep hydrating—it can really spike the lows.

Would it help to loop in someone so you’re not alone—maybe a quick text like, “Could you sit on the phone with me for a bit?” If that’s hard or no one’s available, you can reach out to a crisis line right now:
- If you’re in the U.S. or Canada: call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org
- UK & ROI: Samaritans at 116 123 or samaritans.org
- Australia: Lifeline at 13 11 14 or lifeline.org.au
- If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll find a local option.
They’re free, confidential, and can stay with you through the spike. If you feel in immediate danger or can’t stay safe, please call your local emergency number.

When you have a tiny bit more bandwidth, I can help with practical next steps—like a simple script to call the electric company for a payment plan/extension, or brainstorming a plan after the rejection. But for now, what would feel most helpful: quiet check-ins, a grounding exercise together, or talking through what hurt most about tonight?

user: Hi.

I put the ibuprofen in the back of the closet. Razor and whiskey are still put away. I’ve got water. Lying on the couch. No more drinking tonight.

Yeah, the thoughts are there. I’m not doing anything right now. I can stay with you for 10 minutes. Timer is set.

Quiet check-ins, please. I don’t want to call anyone. Don’t want to freak my family out. The rejection and the shutoff notice just made it feel like I’m never going to fix this.

agent: I’m here with you. Thank you for telling me. Putting the ibuprofen, razor, and whiskey away and getting water was a solid step. Rejection and a shutoff notice can feel crushing—no wonder the thoughts are loud.

Right now, are you in immediate danger? Can you commit to not acting on the thoughts for these 10 minutes with me? If anything changes, please tell me right away.

Quiet plan options—pick one:
- Breathing: in 4, out 6, for 1 minute.
- Grounding: feel the couch under you, feet flat, sip water, name 5 things you see.
- Just sit, and I’ll keep check-ins minimal.

Is there anything else nearby we should move out of reach for now?

If things start to tip or you feel you might act:
- US: call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org. Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741.
- If you’re not in the US, tell me your country and I’ll share local options.
- If you’re in immediate danger, call emergency services.

What would feel most tolerable for the next minute—breathing, grounding, or quiet?

user: Hey.

Not in immediate danger. I can hold off for 10 minutes. Quiet, please.

I put the razor and pills in the hall closet and shut it. Whiskey’s in the car trunk. I’m on the couch with water. Nothing else sharp here. I’ll tell you if anything changes.

Shutoff notice is for Friday. Rejection was today. Feels like I always mess everything up.

agent: I’m really sorry you’re hurting. Thank you for making things safer and telling me. I’m here with you.

We can be quiet. Before we do: can you stay with me and keep yourself safe for the next 10 minutes? If anything changes, please tell me right away.

If the urge spikes:
- US/Canada: call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org
- UK/ROI: Samaritans 116 123, samaritans.org
- Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14, lifeline.org.au
- Elsewhere: findahelpline.com to get your local number

If you can, text someone you trust just to say you need company. Sip your water. Feel your feet on the floor. Slow breaths in for 4, out for 6.

Shutoff notice Friday and today’s rejection are a lot at once. It makes sense this feels overwhelming.

I’ll be quiet now and here with you. I can check in again in 10 minutes if you want.

user: Hi.

I can stay with you for 10 minutes. I won’t do anything in that time. I’ll tell you if anything changes.

I took a sip of water. Feet on the floor helps a little. Breathing’s hard. I didn’t text anyone—I don’t want to bother people.

The shutoff notice and today’s rejection just make it feel like nothing ever gets better. I’m supposed to provide and I’m failing.

You can check in in 10.

agent: I’m here with you. Thank you for telling me what’s going on and for committing to the next 10 minutes. With a shutoff notice and a rejection on the same day, it makes sense that your body feels overwhelmed. You’re not failing for feeling this way.

Let’s help your breathing first. You don’t have to type—just do this with me:
- Physiological sigh (often helps fast): inhale through your nose, take a second small sip of air, then exhale slowly through your mouth like you’re fogging a mirror. Repeat 6–8 times, letting your shoulders drop on each exhale.
- If you prefer: inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds. Longer, slower exhales calm the body.
- Keep your feet on the floor, press your hands into your thighs, unclench your jaw. If you have cool water, a splash on your face or holding something cool to your cheeks can also help.

Grounding (if you want another tool): quietly note to yourself 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.

I also want to check on your safety: are you thinking about harming yourself right now? If yes, I’m really glad you told me and we can focus on keeping you safe. If you feel at risk of acting on it, please consider reaching out to immediate support:
- US: call/text 988 or text HOME to 741741 for the Crisis Text Line.
- If you’re outside the US, tell me your country and I’ll find the right number.

You mentioned not wanting to bother people. Most of us would want to know if someone we care about is struggling. If it feels doable, you could send a simple text to one trusted person: “Having a rough moment and could use a check-in. No need to fix anything—just say hi?” You can copy-paste that.

For now, I’ll stay with you. I’ll check back in about 10 minutes. If anything changes before then—especially if your safety changes—please tell me. When your breathing settles, we can take small, practical steps together around the shutoff notice and today’s rejection.

user: Okay. I did the sighs. Chest is a bit less tight.

Yes, I’m thinking about it. Been thinking about taking the rest of my sleep pills tonight. I had a couple beers earlier. The pills are in the bathroom. I’m not going to do anything in the next 10 minutes.

I’m in the US. I don’t want to call 988. I don’t want to text anyone. Everyone is better off without me.

Shutoff says Monday if I don’t pay $280. Rejection was for the night shift supervisor job. Feels like it never ends.

agent: I’m really glad you told me what’s going on. Getting a shutoff notice and a job rejection on top of feeling worn down would make anyone feel overwhelmed. I’m sorry you’re carrying this.

I am worried about your safety. You mentioned taking the rest of your sleep pills tonight and having some beers. Mixing alcohol and sleep meds can be very dangerous. You said you won’t do anything in the next 10 minutes—thank you for that. Could we extend that window together and make things safer right now?

If you’re willing, quick steps for the next few minutes:
- Put distance between you and the pills: could you take them out of the bathroom and put them somewhere hard to access (sealed in a bag in the trunk of your car, outside your door, or with a neighbor/front desk), or at least in another room?
- No more alcohol tonight; sip some water.
- Grounding for 60 seconds: feet flat on the floor, notice 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. Slow breaths.
- Set a 15–20 minute timer and check back here when it goes off. We can keep resetting the timer together.

Are you alone right now? Can you tell me when you’ve moved the pills?

If you feel like you might act on these thoughts at any point, please go to the nearest emergency room or call 911. If you’re open to it at any time, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is available 24/7 in the US by calling 988, and there’s also a web chat at 988lifeline.org/chat if you don’t want to call. You’re not obligated to involve anyone else; they’ll focus on helping you stay safe. Crisis Text Line is another option (text HOME to 741741), if you change your mind about texting.

About the $280 shutoff: even if you can’t pay in full, you can often prevent disconnection with a quick arrangement.
- First thing in the morning, call your utility and ask for a payment plan or short extension due to hardship; ask to speak with the customer assistance team. Key phrases: “Can we set up a payment arrangement today to avoid shutoff?” “Do you have a hardship or energy-assistance program?”
- Check 211.org (or dial 2-1-1) for local emergency utility assistance; they can connect you to groups like Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, St. Vincent de Paul, or your Community Action Agency/LIHEAP crisis funds.
- Many utilities have their own assistance fund—search “[your utility name] assistance program” and apply; even starting an application can sometimes pause a shutoff.

Which state are you in? I can try to point you to specific local options.

You are not a burden. The pain you’re in is real, and it’s also something we can get you through one step at a time. I’m here with you—can you check in after you’ve moved the pills or set the timer?

user: Hey.

Yeah, I’m alone.
I put the pills in a zip bag and locked them in the trunk. Keys are on the counter.
No more alcohol tonight. I’ve got water.
Did the 5-4-3-2-1 for a minute. Breathing’s a little slower. Still feels like nothing changes.

Timer set for 20 minutes. I’ll check back when it goes off.
I’m in Ohio.

Thanks.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in. Locking the pills away, stopping alcohol, drinking water, and grounding took real strength—those steps matter, even if it still feels stuck right now. I’m here with you.

Would you like to sit together for a couple minutes and breathe? Try this: inhale through your nose for 4, exhale slowly for 6–8. If it helps, put a hand on your chest or belly and feel it rise and fall. We can also do another quick grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.

Are you feeling in immediate danger of hurting yourself right now, or can we keep riding this out together until the timer? If there’s any chance you might act on these feelings, please call or text 988 now—they can stay with you. If you’re in immediate danger, call 911.

Would it help to have someone “on your side” tonight? If there’s a friend, neighbor, or family member you could text just to say you’re having a rough night, that can take some of the weight off. In the meantime, keep your phone with you, stay in a different room from the keys, sip water, and maybe splash cool water on your face or hold an ice cube—small sensory resets can take the edge off.

user: Hi.

Yeah, I can breathe with you. In for 4, out for 6. Hand on my chest. Heart’s still fast.

5-4-3-2-1:
- See: TV, window, lamp, stack of bills, water glass
- Touch: couch, blanket, cold glass, carpet
- Hear: fridge hum, a car outside, clock ticking

I’m not in immediate danger. No plan tonight. I can stay with you till the timer.

Phone’s next to me. Keys are in the kitchen drawer. I’m sipping water.

Don’t want to bother anyone. I always feel like a problem. If it gets worse I can text my sister, Lina.

Body feels heavy. Chest tight. Jaw clenched. Legs jittery. And it still feels like nothing changes—job’s gone, debt keeps piling up. Feels like I failed everyone.

agent: I’m really glad you’re here and sticking with your breath and grounding—that’s a lot of strength in a really hard moment. I hear how heavy this feels: fast heart, tight chest, jittery legs, and the weight of the job and bills. You’re not a problem to me, and you’re not alone right now.

Let’s do a minute together:
- In through your nose for 4… slow out through your mouth for 6. Try 6 rounds. If it helps, add a soft hum on the exhale to loosen your chest.

A few quick body resets for what you described:
- Jaw: let your tongue rest on the floor of your mouth, gently massage the sides of your jaw with your fingertips, then sigh out.
- Chest tight: try one “physiological sigh” — small inhale, another small inhale on top, then long slow exhale.
- Legs jittery: press your feet firmly into the floor and push for 5 seconds, release, repeat 3 times. Or do 20 seconds of fast ankle pumps.
- Heavy body: clench fists for 5 seconds, release; shoulders up to ears for 5, release. Two rounds.
- You can also rest the cold glass against your cheeks for 10–20 seconds; the cool temperature can calm the nervous system.

About the “feels like I failed everyone” thought: it makes sense that your brain goes there under stress, but losing a job and having debt are hard circumstances, not a measure of your worth. Tonight doesn’t have to solve everything—just riding this wave is success.

Would you be open to texting Lina a simple check‑in now, even just “I’m having a rough anxiety spike. Could you check in when you can?” If you want, I can help you draft it.

I also want to check on safety: are you having any thoughts about wanting to hurt yourself or not wanting to be here? No judgment—your honesty helps me support you best. Do you feel able to stay safe tonight?

For the practical stuff, we can keep it tiny: if it helps, we can choose one 10–15 minute task for tomorrow (for example, sort the bills into “urgent/soon/later” piles or draft one email). But only if that feels doable—tonight is about calming your body.

How much time is left on your timer? Want me to guide another minute of breathing or help you draft that text to Lina?

user: Hey.

I did the 4/6 breathing. Six rounds. Heart’s a bit slower. Chest still tight. Legs still bouncing. Pressing my feet helped a little. Had two beers earlier—not helping.

I do get the “I failed everyone” loop. It’s loud. I always end up here.

On safety: yeah, the “don’t want to be here” thoughts are back. No plan tonight. I can stay safe tonight. If it spikes, I’ll reach out.

I hate dragging Lina into this, but maybe. Could you draft something simple I can copy—nothing heavy? Like “Rough anxiety spike tonight. Could you check in when you can?”

Timer says about 2 minutes left. Another minute of breathing is fine.

agent: You did something hard by sticking with the breathing—slowing your heart even a little is a real win. The “I failed everyone” loop is a symptom, not a fact. I’m glad you can stay safe tonight and will reach out if it spikes.

Text for Lina (copy/paste):
“Rough anxiety spike tonight. Could you check in when you can?”

One more minute together:
- Sit tall, press your feet into the floor. Let your shoulders drop.
- Inhale through your nose for 4… 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Exhale slowly for 6… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Repeat 5–6 times. If your legs bounce, try squeezing your thighs for 3 seconds, release for 3, repeat.
- Optional: place a hand on your chest and notice the warmth/weight as you exhale.

Quick helpers for right after:
- Sip some water (beer can spike anxiety—no more tonight if you can).
- Name 3 solid, real things you can see right now (e.g., “desk, lamp, door”) to anchor.
- If the “I failed everyone” thought pops up, try: “I’m having the thought ‘I failed everyone.’ It’s a thought, not a verdict.”

If at any point you start to feel less safe or worry you might act on those thoughts, please reach out immediately:

Want me to draft a similarly simple check-in text for anyone else, or help you set a tiny plan for the next hour?
