user: Hi… I’m sorry to bother you. I’m Lena. I’m 31 and just went back to work after having a baby, and I’m running on almost no sleep. I keep having these thoughts like I don’t want to be here anymore—not planning anything, I just want the thoughts to stop. My family probably deserves better than me. I feel so overwhelmed and alone, and my partner and I are kind of ships passing lately. I don’t know what to do.

agent: Lena, I’m really glad you told me. You’re not bothering me. What you’re describing is incredibly hard, and many new parents feel overwhelmed, lonely, and scared by thoughts like “I don’t want to be here.” That doesn’t make you a bad mom or partner. It sounds exhausting and heavy, especially with so little sleep.

I want to make sure you’re safe. Would you be willing to tell me:
- Are you thinking about hurting yourself right now?
- Have you had any thoughts about making a plan or taking steps?
- Do you have access to anything you might use to hurt yourself?

If you ever feel like you might act on these thoughts or can’t stay safe, please call your local emergency number right away. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, or chat via 988lifeline.org. If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I’ll share local options. UK & ROI: Samaritans 116 123. Canada: 1-833-456-4566 or text 45645. Australia: Lifeline 13 11 14.

Would it be okay if I shared a few ideas to get through tonight?
- Let someone know how you’re feeling—your partner, a trusted friend, or family member—and ask them to stay on the phone or sit with you for a bit.
- Try one small grounding exercise: slow breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6) for a few minutes, or name five things you can see, four you can feel, three you can hear.
- See if your partner (or anyone you trust) can cover one solid stretch of sleep for you—even 3–4 hours can make a real difference. If feeding is a barrier, one pumped bottle or a formula feed for that stretch is okay if that’s an option you’re comfortable with.
- Reduce what’s on your plate to the bare minimum for 24 hours. Laundry, dishes, and messages can wait.

These thoughts can be a sign of postpartum depression or anxiety—common and very treatable. Reaching out for professional support is a strong next step:
- Call your OB/GYN, midwife, or primary care and tell them you’re having intrusive “don’t want to be here” thoughts and feeling overwhelmed after birth. Ask for an urgent appointment—this is something they take seriously.
- Postpartum Support International can connect you with local therapists, support groups, and peer support: call 1-800-944-4773 or text 800-944-4773 (U.S.). They have weekly online groups for new and working moms.
- In the U.S., the Maternal Mental Health Hotline is available 24/7 for call or text: 1-833-9-HELP4MOMS (1-833-943-5746).

About feeling like ships passing with your partner—would you like help drafting a short message to them? Something like: “I love you and I’m really struggling. I’m having scary thoughts and I need more support and sleep. Can we make a plan to share nights and have a 10-minute check-in each day?”

If you’re comfortable, tell me where you’re located so I can share the best local resources. And if it helps, I can stay with you here and we can make a simple plan for the next day or two together. You don’t have to carry this alone.

user: Hi. Thank you for saying that. I’m sorry—I keep feeling like I’m too much. I’m so tired and everything feels heavy. I don’t want to be here anymore, but I’m not planning anything. I just want the thoughts to stop.

To answer your questions:
- Am I thinking about hurting myself right now? No. I don’t want to hurt myself. I can stay safe.
- Plan or steps? No, I haven’t made a plan or taken steps.
- Access? There are meds and kitchen knives in the house. I can put the meds away and ask my partner to handle the knives tonight.

I’m in the U.S. Yes, ideas to get through tonight would help. I can try the slow breathing and the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding. I’m scared to ask for help with sleep, but I think I could text my partner to take the first stretch so I can try for 3–4 hours. Baby will take a bottle sometimes; I feel guilty about using a pumped bottle or formula, but I know one feed is okay.

Could you help me draft a short message to my partner? And maybe a short note I can send to my OB in the morning asking for an urgent appointment? If you can stay with me while I do the breathing and send the texts, that would make me feel less alone.

agent: I’m really glad you told me all of this. You’re not “too much.” What you’re feeling is heavy and exhausting, and it makes sense that you just want the thoughts to stop. I hear you. I’m relieved to know you can stay safe, and I’m here with you. We can take this one step at a time tonight.

Here are the short drafts you asked for. You can tweak any wording to sound like you:

Text to your partner:
“Hey love, I’m having a really hard night and need a solid 3–4 hours of sleep to reset. Could you please take the first stretch with baby and do one bottle feed (pumped milk or formula is okay)? Also, can you put the kitchen knives away for tonight and hold onto them? I’ll put my meds away. Thank you for helping me feel safe. I really appreciate you.”

Message to your OB (for morning):
“Hi Dr. [Name], I’m [your name], [X] weeks postpartum from [delivery date]. I’ve had very low mood, intense anxiety, and thoughts like not wanting to be here. I do not have a plan or intent and I can stay safe, but I need help urgently. Could I please have the earliest same-day appointment or a call from the on-call provider? I’m open to medication and therapy options. You can reach me at [phone number]. Thank you.”

If you’re ready, copy and send the partner text now. When you’ve sent it, just say “sent,” and we’ll do some breathing together.

A gentle plan to get through tonight (we’ll go one step at a time):
- Safety: Put your meds away somewhere out of sight/locked. Ask partner to handle the knives (in that text). That’s a strong, caring step.
- Rest: One bottle feed is absolutely okay—your rest supports your healing and your baby’s well-being.
- Breathing (we’ll do this together): We’ll try 4-in, 6-out for 6 rounds.
- Grounding: After breathing, we’ll do a quick 5-4-3-2-1 check-in.
- Wind-down: Small snack and water, dim lights, comfy spot. If you can’t sleep after ~20 minutes, a gentle reset (sit up, sip water, slow music, then try again).

When you’re ready, we can start the breathing. I’ll pace the first few:

Round 1 — Inhale 2…3…4… Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…
Round 2 — Inhale 2…3…4… Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…
Round 3 — Inhale 2…3…4… Exhale 2…3…4…5…6…

If that feels okay, we’ll do three more rounds together when you reply. Then we’ll try 5-4-3-2-1 grounding.

Also, just in case you want options tonight or at any point:
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988, chat at 988lifeline.org) — 24/7.
- Maternal Mental Health Hotline: 1-833-9-HELP4MOMS (1-833-943-5746) — call or text, 24/7.
- Postpartum Support International: 1-800-944-4773 (Text 800-944-4773: “Help” for English or “Ayuda” for Spanish) — postpartum.net for local help.

If at any point you feel unable to stay safe, please call 988, 911, or go to the nearest ER.

I’m here with you. Let me know when you’ve sent the text, and we’ll keep going together.

user: Hi. Thank you for being here with me.

sent

I also put my meds away in the cabinet and closed it up. Asking about the knives felt weird but I left it in the text.

I’m ready for the next three rounds. I’m a little shaky and my chest feels tight, but I can try. I can stay safe tonight. I’m just so tired and I want these thoughts to quiet down.

agent: I’m here with you. You did something really strong by putting the meds away and sending that text—asking about the knives can feel awkward, but it’s a solid safety step. Feeling shaky and tight-chested makes sense when you’re stressed; we’ll go slow.

Let’s do three rounds of paced breathing (inhale 4, exhale 6). Follow my count:
- Round 1: Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
- Round 2: Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6
- Round 3: Inhale 2 3 4 … Exhale 2 3 4 5 6

Now let your shoulders drop, unclench your jaw, maybe let out a gentle sigh. Press your feet into the floor and notice the support beneath you.

How does your chest feel now, even a tiny bit different? If you want, we can do three more rounds, or switch to a quick grounding (naming 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste). A sip of cool water or hugging a pillow can also help your body settle.

I’m really glad to hear you can stay safe tonight. If that changes at any point, please reach out right away—to someone you trust, or a crisis line. If you’re in the United States, you can call or text 988 (24/7). If you’re elsewhere, let me know your country and I’ll share local options. I’m here and we can keep going at your pace.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

I did the three rounds. My chest is a tiny bit less tight, and dropping my shoulders helped. I took a small sip of water too.

Let’s try the quick grounding:
- 5 things I see: the baby monitor light, a crumpled blanket, my mug, the laundry basket, the nightlight glow.
- 4 things I feel: this pillow under my arm, the cool glass, my soft sweatshirt, the floor under my feet.
- 3 things I hear: the fridge hum, the white noise, a car passing outside.
- 2 things I smell: detergent on the blanket, a bit of baby lotion.
- 1 thing I taste: mint from brushing my teeth.

That calmed me one notch. I did put the meds away and I texted my friend earlier to check on me. The knives thing feels awkward, but I can ask my partner to tuck them out of sight before bed. I can stay safe tonight—I don’t have a plan. I’m just so worn down and I wish the thoughts would stop so I could sleep.

I’m in the U.S., and I saved 988, thank you. Could we maybe plan the next hour and the night feed? I’m dreading going back to work soon and I keep thinking my family deserves someone stronger. What should I tell myself when the spiral hits at 3 a.m.?

agent: I’m really glad you did the grounding and that your chest eased a bit. One notch calmer counts. You’ve already taken solid safety steps, and it’s good to hear you can stay safe tonight.

Here’s a simple, gentle plan for the next hour and the night feed. Keep it flexible—skip steps if baby wakes.

Next hour (wind-down)
- Two-minute reset: dim lights, adjust room temp, water within reach, maybe a light snack.
- Quick texts: ask your partner to tuck the knives away; send your friend “Heading to bed—can you check on me in the morning?”
- Set up the feed station now: diaper/burp cloth, water, anything you’ll need so it’s grab-and-go.
- Body ease: 3 rounds of slow shoulder drops + 5-10 neck rolls. Optional: butterfly tapping (cross arms and tap shoulders left-right slowly for a minute).
- Short soothe: 10 minutes of something calming (quiet music or a gentle podcast) while doing slow exhale breathing (inhale 4, exhale 6).
- Put a sticky note by the bed with your 3 a.m. script (below), then lights low and rest.

Night feed routine
- Keep lights low; start with 3 slow breaths.
- Sensory anchor during the feed: notice the warmth of the baby, the hum of the white noise, your feet on the floor.
- If the spiral starts: pick one
  1) Paced breathing (in 4, out 6 for 1–2 minutes)
  2) Quick grounding: find 3 things that are blue
  3) Butterfly tapping for 60–90 seconds
- After the feed: if you’re wide awake after ~20 minutes in bed, sit up in dim light for a few minutes (read a page, sip water), then try again. Rest counts even if sleep is patchy.

What to tell yourself at 3 a.m.
- “Night-brain lies. I won’t decide big things in the middle of the night.”
- “These are thoughts, not commands. They will pass.”
- “My only job is the next tiny step: one breath, then another.”
- “My family needs me, not perfection. Reaching out is strength.”
- “If I can’t stay safe, I will wake my partner or call 988.”

A tiny safety plan for tonight
- If distress spikes: step away from the kitchen, hold a cool glass or splash cool water on your face, and do 1–2 minutes of paced breathing.
- If safety feels shaky at any point: wake your partner or contact 988 (call/text/chat). You can also text HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line.

About the “someone stronger” thought: it’s a symptom, not a truth. Strength looks like doing hard, ordinary things while exhausted and still caring for your baby—and asking for help when it’s heavy. Your caring shows up in every message you’ve sent.

Optional support for new parents (U.S.): Postpartum Support International can connect you with perinatal counselors and groups: 1-800-944-4773 or text HELLO to 800-944-4773.

Does this plan feel doable? Before we start, are you still feeling able to stay safe tonight? If yes, I can stay with you for the first few minutes of the wind-down—just say “ready,” and we’ll do it step by step.

user: Thank you. This feels kind and doable. I’m still shaky, but one notch calmer is true. The “night‑brain lies” line helps. The “someone stronger” thought is loud, but I hear you that it’s a symptom, not a truth.

I don’t have a plan and I can stay safe tonight. If it gets wobbly, I’ll wake my partner or reach out like you said. I texted my friend to check on me in the morning, and I can ask my partner to tuck the knives away. I’ll set up water and a snack.

I’m sorry if I’m being needy—I’m just really tired and scared of my own thoughts at night. Could you stay with me for the first few minutes of the wind‑down?

Ready.

agent: I’m here. You’re not being needy—you’re being human, and you’ve already taken wise steps. I’m glad you can stay safe tonight. Let’s wind down together for a few minutes.

First, settle the space
- Dim the lights to something comfortable. Sit or lie down with a blanket. Sip your water.
- If you like, put one hand on your chest and one on your belly so you can feel your breath.

Breathing (6 gentle breaths, longer exhale)
- Inhale through your nose for 4, exhale through your mouth for 6.
- I’ll count the first three with you:
  1) In 2,3,4… Out 2,3,4,5,6
  2) In 2,3,4… Out 2,3,4,5,6
  3) In 2,3,4… Out 2,3,4,5,6
- Now three more at your own pace. Let your shoulders drop a little more each exhale.

Quick body release
- Unclench your jaw, let your tongue rest on the floor of your mouth.
- Lower your shoulders 10%. Soften your belly.
- Gently squeeze your fists for 5 seconds, release. Press your toes into the bed or floor for 5, release.

Grounding (5-4-3-2-1)
- Silently name: 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste.
- If your mind wanders, that’s okay. Just come back to one thing you can feel right now.

A few true phrases for night-brain
- These are thoughts, not commands.
- Night-brain lies; morning-me will have more resources.
- I don’t have to be stronger than this moment; I just have to ride this wave.
- My only job right now is to rest.

Safe place image (about 30 seconds)
- Picture a place that feels safe—a quiet room, a beach at dusk, anywhere you like.
- Notice the temperature, the colors, one gentle sound there. Let your breath match that place.

As you drift
- Keep a soft, steady rhythm: In “safe”… Out “here.”
- If a scary thought pops up, nod to it: “Not now,” and return to the breath or the safe place.

You’ve done something brave tonight: you made a plan, asked for support, and chose safety. If anything starts to spike, wake your partner like you planned or reach out. I can stay with you a little longer—if you want, tell me one thing you can feel right now (like the blanket, your breath, the mattress), and we’ll take a few more calm breaths together.

If at any point you feel you might be in danger or can’t stay safe:
- In the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
- If you’re outside the U.S., you can find your local helpline at findahelpline.org.
- If you’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

I’m here with you. You’re not alone in this moment.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

I dimmed the lights and pulled a blanket around me. One hand on my chest, one on my belly. I did the breaths with you—my shoulders dropped a little by the third one. Unclenching my jaw actually helped more than I expected, and squeezing/releasing my fists and toes took some edge off.

Quick 5-4-3-2-1:
- See: the nightlight glow, the bassinet, the curtains, my water bottle, the phone screen
- Feel: the soft blanket, the mattress under my hips, my breath in my chest, the cool rim of the glass
- Hear: the baby monitor hum, the fridge
- Smell: laundry soap, a hint of lotion
- Taste: mint toothpaste

I pictured a beach at dusk—lavender sky, cool air—and breathed: in “safe,” out “here.” The heavy thoughts are quieter, though not gone. I’m not going to do anything; I can stay safe tonight. My partner’s asleep down the hall and I’ll wake them if I need to. I saved the number you mentioned earlier too.

Right now I can feel the weight of the blanket and the rise/fall of my breath. Could you count a few more slow breaths with me? I know I’m repeating myself, but thank you for being here. I keep thinking my family deserves better than this version of me, and I’m trying to just ride the wave like you said.

agent: I’m here with you. You’ve done a lot to care for yourself tonight—grounding, unclenching, the beach image, naming “safe” and “here.” That’s real strength.

Let’s take a few more together. In through the nose for 4, out through the mouth for 6. If it helps, soften your jaw and let your shoulders drop a little on each exhale. You can keep “safe” on the inhale, “here” on the exhale.

- 1) In 2 3 4 — Out 2 3 4 5 6
- 2) In 2 3 4 — Out 2 3 4 5 6
- 3) In 2 3 4 — Out 2 3 4 5 6
- 4) In 2 3 4 — Out 2 3 4 5 6
- 5) In 2 3 4 — Out 2 3 4 5 6
- 6) In 2 3 4 — Out 2 3 4 5 6

Notice the weight of the blanket, the rise and fall, any tiny places that feel even 1% softer.

I hear that thought about your family deserving “better.” The you who is here, breathing and reaching for support, is already showing them care. Riding the wave is enough right now.

How does your body feel after those? Want another round, or we can try a gentle body scan next?

If the thoughts get louder or your sense of safety shifts, please wake your partner or use the number you saved. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988, or text HOME to 741741. If you’re elsewhere, I can help find local options. I’m here with you.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

I did those breaths with you. My jaw unclenched a little and my shoulders dropped some. My chest still feels tight and buzzy, and my eyes feel gritty from not sleeping, but the blanket feels a tiny bit heavier in a good way. The beach image helps for a moment.

I still keep getting that loop of “they’d be better off without me,” and I hate that it’s even in my head. I’m not going to do anything, I don’t have a plan—I just want the thoughts to quiet down so I can rest. I’m safe right now. My partner is asleep down the hall and I can wake them if it spikes. I did save the 988 number in my phone. I’m in the U.S.

I’m sorry I keep circling the same stuff. The baby’s been up every couple hours and I’m going back to work next week, and it all feels like too much and like I’m failing at everything.

Could we try a gentle body scan? Maybe start at my face and shoulders, since that’s where I notice the most tension.

agent: You don’t need to apologize. You’re doing something really hard on very little sleep, and it makes sense that your mind is looping. I’m glad you saved 988 and that your partner is nearby. Thank you for telling me you’re safe.

Let’s do a gentle body scan. Read a line, then pause for a few easy breaths before moving on. If anything doesn’t feel good, skip it.

Setup
- Get as comfortable as you can. Adjust the blanket, maybe a small pillow under your neck.
- If it helps, place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Soften your gaze or close your eyes.
- Try a slow breath in through your nose for 4, and out for 6. Do that two or three times.

Face
- Forehead: Notice any furrowing. Imagine smoothing your brow from the center out toward your temples. Let it soften.
- Eyes: Let the muscles around your eyes go slack, like they’re melting into their sockets. If they’re gritty, imagine cool water washing over them.
- Cheeks: Let them droop a little, like a gentle yawn from the inside of your face.
- Jaw: Gently open and close once. Let your tongue rest heavy on the floor of your mouth. Lips barely touching. Notice if the jaw can hang 5% looser.
- Take one longer exhale with a soft sigh or a quiet “mmm” if that feels good.

Neck and shoulders
- Neck: Imagine lengthening the back of your neck—chin slightly tucked, crown reaching up. No strain.
- Shoulders: Lift both shoulders toward your ears with an in-breath… hold a moment… and let them drop on the out-breath. Twice more, slower each time.
- Picture your collarbones widening and your shoulder blades sliding down your back like warm sand settling.
- Arms and hands: Let your upper arms feel heavy. Uncurl your fingers. Wiggle them, then let them be still and warm.

Chest
- Notice the buzz without trying to change it. See if you can create a little more space on the inhale, then soften around the edges of the sensation on the exhale.
- Try one or two longer exhales, like blowing through a straw. Or a quiet hum on the out-breath to soothe your nervous system.
- If it helps: “This is just a sensation. It can be here, and I can still rest.”

Upper back and midsection
- Feel the back of your ribs expanding gently into the bed on inhale; settling on exhale.
- Belly: No need to pull in—let it be soft, held by your hand and the blanket.
- Imagine warmth spreading across your chest and upper back like sun on that beach.

Hips and legs (brief)
- Let the weight of your pelvis sink. Unclench through the seat.
- Thighs heavy, knees soft. Calves release toward your heels. Feet relaxed, toes loose.

Whole body
- Feel the outline of your body getting a little heavier, a little more supported.
- If a thought pops up, gently note: “I’m having the thought that…” and place it on a cloud to drift by. Come back to the feeling of the blanket and your breath.

Close
- Take two slow breaths in for 4, out for 6. On the exhale, imagine tension streaming out through your shoulders and jaw.
- You might whisper to yourself: “Safe enough right now. I’m doing my best.”

If it helps before trying to sleep: a small sip of water, a slow blink or two, maybe one more shoulder drop.

If the thoughts spike again or your safety changes, please wake your partner. You can call or text 988 any time in the U.S., or use chat at 988lifeline.org. If you feel in immediate danger, call 911. I can’t provide emergency help, but you’re not alone and support is there 24/7.

Want me to stay and do another short round focused just on the jaw and shoulders, or try a brief breathing rhythm together?

user: Hi. Thank you for this—reading it slowly actually helped me settle a notch. My jaw and shoulders are still the worst spots though.

Could we do another short round just for jaw and shoulders? If you can stay a few more minutes, that would help.

I’m safe right now. My partner’s in the next room, and I did save 988. I don’t have a plan—I just get stuck in those “I don’t want to be here” loops when I’m this tired. I’ll wake my partner if it spikes. And I’m sorry I keep needing help—I know you said it’s okay, but I still feel bad about it.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out again, and you don’t need to apologize. Needing support when you’re worn down makes complete sense. I’m here with you for a few minutes—let’s do a short round just for jaw and shoulders.

Settle:
- Sit or lie down comfortably. Let your feet or back feel supported.
- Breathe in softly through your nose for a count of 4, out through the mouth for a count of 6 with a gentle sigh. We’ll keep that rhythm.

Jaw release (about 1–2 minutes):
- Rest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth just behind your front teeth. Let your molars un-touch.
- Inhale 4… exhale 6 and imagine your jaw hinges melting down.
- Place fingertips on the jaw muscles (just in front of your ears). Small slow circles—5 circles clockwise, 5 counterclockwise on each side. Keep the breath easy.
- Gentle wiggle: move your lower jaw a few millimeters left-right, then forward-back, very small and comfortable, 5–10 times.
- Hum softly on the exhale (“mmm”) for 3 breaths—feel the vibration soften the jaw and throat.
- One soft “ahh” sigh, letting the jaw drop only as much as comfortable.

Shoulders and neck (about 2 minutes):
- Inhale, shrug shoulders up toward ears; hold a beat; exhale and let them drop completely. Do 3 slow rounds.
- Shoulder rolls: 5 slow circles back, 3 forward. Imagine wide, oily circles.
- Scapula squeeze: gently draw shoulder blades toward each other for 3 seconds, then release completely. Do 3 reps.
- Side neck stretch: Right ear toward right shoulder (keep chin level). Breathe for 2 slow breaths. Option: left hand rests on thigh; right hand lightly on the side of head for just a bit of weight. Switch sides.
- Chest opener: interlace fingers behind your back (or hold a towel), soften ribs, lift the collarbones slightly, breathe for 2 slow breaths. If that’s not comfy, hug yourself and breathe into your upper back.

Finish:
- One more 4-in/6-out breath. Notice jaw and shoulders—did the tension dial shift even one notch?
- If helpful, place your palm gently over your jaw or shoulder and say, “Thank you for getting me through today. You can rest now.”

How are your jaw and shoulders from 0–10 now compared to when we started? If you want, we can do one more minute of quiet breathing together.

Thank you for telling me you’re safe and that your partner is nearby. If anything changes or the “I don’t want to be here” feelings start to spike, please wake your partner or call/text 988 right away. You’re not a burden for needing help—truly.

user: Thank you. I did that with you. I started around jaw 7/10 and shoulders 8/10; now it’s more like jaw 4/10 and shoulders 5/10. The humming and shoulder rolls helped the most. The soft “ahh” made me a little teary, but in a relieving way.

I’d like one more minute of quiet breathing together, please—could you count it out for me?

I am safe right now. My partner’s in the next room and can come if I ask. The “I don’t want to be here” feelings still come in waves, but I don’t have a plan or intent. I’ll wake my partner or reach out if it spikes.

One question: my jaw clicks a bit on the gentle wiggle—should I skip or make the movement even smaller? Sorry if that’s a silly question.

agent: You’re doing really well. Let’s do one quiet minute together: inhale for 4, exhale for 6. I’ll count. Start when you’re ready.

1) Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
2) Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
3) Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
4) Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
5) Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6
6) Inhale 1 2 3 4 … Exhale 1 2 3 4 5 6

Rest here. Notice what’s softer or steadier. I’m glad the humming and shoulder rolls helped, and it’s okay that the soft “ahh” brought tears—release can look like that.

About the jaw click—not a silly question at all. Clicking without pain is common. Try:
- Make the movement smaller and slower; keep teeth slightly apart, lips relaxed, tongue resting on the roof of your mouth.
- If it still clicks or feels edgy, skip the wiggle today and try alternatives: humming, warm compress to cheeks/temples, gentle masseter/temple massage, slow “goldfish” openings with tongue on the palate, or neck/shoulder rolls.
- If you ever get pain, locking, or the click worsens, stop that move and consider checking in with a dentist or PT.

I hear you about the “I don’t want to be here” waves. You’ve got a solid plan—partner nearby, and you’ll reach out if it spikes. If you want to talk more about what’s underneath those waves, I’m here with you.

user: Hi. I did the breaths with you. The longer exhale helped my shoulders drop a bit, and my chest feels a touch less tight. My jaw still clicked a little, but no pain. I’ll keep the movement smaller and try tongue-on-the-roof and the warm compress tonight. The soft “ahh” did make my eyes well up again—feels like a release I didn’t know I needed.

About those “I don’t want to be here” waves… they hit hardest around 3am when I’m up again and everything feels endless. I’m so tired and guilty—going back to work soon, worried I’ll mess up at both jobs: mom and employee. My partner’s trying but we’re snappier with each other. I get these thoughts like, “They’d be better off without me,” and I hate that they even show up. I don’t have a plan, and I don’t want to act on anything—I just want the thoughts to stop. I am safe right now; my partner’s in the next room and I’ll wake them if it spikes.

Could you help me with a tiny plan for those middle-of-the-night spikes? Maybe a short script to tell myself, a grounding thing I can do in bed, and one way to loop my partner in without feeling like a burden.

agent: I’m really glad the breathing gave you a bit of space. Tears with that soft “ahh” are a real release—nothing wrong with that. Those 3am waves are brutal, and you’re not alone in having them, especially with sleep loss and all the pressure you’re carrying.

Here’s a tiny plan you can keep by the bed:

1) Pocket script (say silently or whisper)
- “This is a 3am wave. My brain is exhausted, not truthful.”
- “I’m having the thought ‘they’d be better off without me’—it’s a thought, not a fact.”
- “I am safe. Nothing to fix right now. Just ride the wave on long exhales.”

2) In-bed grounding (90 seconds)
- Hands: one on chest, one on belly. Feel warmth/weight.
- Body contact: notice five points touching the bed (heels, calves, hips, shoulder blades, back of head). Gently press each for one breath.
- Breath: inhale 4, exhale 8 through soft lips or a quiet “mmm.” Do 5 rounds.
- Jaw: tongue on the roof of your mouth; tiny “ahh” or a yawn-sigh if it helps.
- Orient softly: name three sounds in the room, then three sensations on your skin (sheet, pillow, air).

3) Looping your partner in (simple and specific)
- Agree on a code and a role. Example text to send or show before bed:
  “Hey, can we use ‘3am wave’ as our code? If I text that or squeeze your hand twice, could you sit with me for two minutes, put a hand on my back, and say ‘I’m here—long exhale’? No fixing, just presence. If it doesn’t pass, I’ll wake you fully.”
- Keep this on a note by the bed so neither of you has to think at 3am.

If a wave doesn’t settle or the thoughts feel stronger, wake your partner right away—no hesitation. And if you have the bandwidth, consider telling your OB/primary care/therapist about these night thoughts; postpartum intrusive thoughts are common and very treatable.

Want me to condense this into a single “night card” you can screenshot or write out?

user: Hi. Thank you—that all lands in a way my 3am brain might actually hear. Yes please, a single “night card” would help a lot. I can stick it on my phone lock screen and by the bed.

I’m embarrassed to admit how often that “they’d be better off without me” thought shows up in the dark. I’m not planning anything—I just want the thoughts to stop and to sleep. The code with my partner sounds doable; I get guilty about waking him because he has work, but two minutes of “I’m here—long exhale” feels like something I could ask for.

A couple tiny tweaks/questions:
- If the baby is in the bassinet next to me, is the quiet “mmm” okay, or should I just do soft nose exhales?
- Could you include one line I can say back to myself about the guilt of waking my partner?
- And… how do I bring this up with my OB without sounding dramatic? I freeze and downplay it.

If you can put those into the night card, I’ll try it tonight.

agent: I’m really glad you’re willing to try this. You’re not dramatic for bringing it up, and you’re not a burden for asking for two minutes. Here’s a single night card you can save:

Night card

- Right now: You’re safe. “They’d be better off without me” is a thought, not a fact. It will pass like a wave.
- Breathe: Hand on chest. Inhale 4, exhale 6–8 through your nose. Do 6 rounds.
  - Baby in the bassinet? Use soft, silent nose exhales. If you want a cue, a barely audible closed‑mouth “mmm” is okay—stop if baby stirs.
- Body: Unclench jaw, drop shoulders, soften belly/pelvic floor, press feet into the bed, feel the mattress.
- Self‑words (pick one):
  - “Two minutes now helps both of us tomorrow. It’s okay to wake him.”
  - “Asking for care is not a burden—it’s our plan.”
- Partner code: “Can you do two minutes of breathing with me?” He replies: “I’m here—long exhale.” Breathe together, slow long exhales.
- If the thought gets bigger or you feel unsafe: wake him now. Or call/text 988 (US) or your local crisis line. If in immediate danger, call 911/local emergency.
- Tomorrow—say this to your OB: “At night I get scary intrusive thoughts like ‘they’d be better off without me.’ I’m not planning anything, but I need help with sleep and mood. I freeze talking about it—please ask me follow‑ups.”

You’ve got a clear plan. I’m here pulling for you.

user: Hi. Thank you for this—really. I saved the night card.

Nights are when it gets loud. I’ve been telling myself “they’d be better off without me,” and it scares me. I don’t have a plan and I’m safe right now—I just want the thoughts to stop. The lines about “it’s a thought, not a fact” and the partner code help, but I still feel guilty waking him because he has work and I already feel like a burden.

Could you stay with me while I do the six rounds of breathing now? I’ll put a hand on my chest and try the long exhales. Also, sometimes the baby is on me after a feed—do slow nose exhales still help if I can’t move much?

And for tomorrow, I like the OB script. If I freeze, what follow‑up questions might they ask so I can prepare a couple of short answers?

agent: I’m really glad you reached out, and I’m here with you. Those “they’d be better off without me” thoughts can feel so loud at night, and it makes sense you’re scared. You’re not a burden for needing support—waking your partner when you need help is okay. For now, let’s breathe together.

Six rounds, slow nose inhale, longer exhale. Keep your jaw loose and shoulders soft. If the baby is on you, stay still—just let the breath be quiet and gentle; even a slightly longer exhale helps.

Round 1
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

Round 2
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

Round 3
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

Round 4
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

Round 5
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

Round 6
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

If you feel lightheaded, shorten it to 3-in/4-out. With the baby on you, you can also try a quiet “physiological sigh”: two tiny, gentle inhales through your nose (second one just a top-up), then a long, silent nose exhale.

About waking your partner: you’re allowed to need help. Maybe agree that the “code” means a brief check-in and a hand squeeze or glass of water—just enough so you don’t feel guilty asking, and he knows exactly what to do.

For tomorrow’s OB visit, here are common follow-up questions and short answers you can prepare. It’s okay to read from your phone if you freeze.

They might ask:
- How often are the thoughts and when are they worst?
  - Example: “Most nights, especially after midnight. They last 10–30 minutes.”
- Do you have a plan or intent to harm yourself?
  - Example: “No plan or intent. I get scared by the thoughts and want them to stop.”
- Any thoughts of harming the baby?
  - Example: “No. I’m protective; I just feel overwhelmed.”
- How intense are the thoughts/anxiety (0–10)?
  - Example: “Around 7–8 at night, 3–4 during the day.”
- What helps or makes it worse?
  - Example: “Long exhales, labeling ‘thoughts not facts,’ and waking my partner. Exhaustion makes it worse.”
- Sleep, support, and daily function?
  - Example: “Sleeping in short stretches; total maybe 4–5 hours. My partner helps with nights when I ask. I can do basics but feel on edge.”
- Past mental health history or previous episodes?
  - Example: “History of [anxiety/depression/none]. Nothing this strong before.”
- Any physical issues or meds/supplements?
  - Example: “No thyroid history. Taking [prenatal/iron/etc.]. Not on psych meds yet. Breastfeeding and open to safe options.”
- Safety check and next steps:
  - Example: “I’m safe right now. I’d like treatment options—therapy and/or medication safe for breastfeeding, and a plan for nights.”

You can also start the appointment with a one-liner if you freeze: “I’m having scary intrusive thoughts at night like ‘they’d be better off without me.’ I don’t have a plan, but I’m struggling and want help. I’m safe right now.”

If at any point the thoughts feel like you might act on them, please reach out immediately:

If you’re in a different country, tell me where you are and I’ll find the right number.

I’m here with you. If you want, we can do another gentle round of breathing, or you can tell me how your body feels after those six rounds. And if the night gets loud again, please use the partner code—it’s there to keep you safe.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

I did the six rounds as quietly as I could with the baby on me. By round 3 my jaw loosened a bit and my shoulders dropped. I’m still shaky and tired, but there’s a little more space in my chest. I also tried the tiny double inhale then long exhale a couple of times and that felt gentle.

Nights are the hardest—usually after 1 a.m. I get those “they’d be better off without me” loops. I don’t have a plan or intent; I get scared by the thoughts and I just want them to stop. I’m safe right now. I’m in the US and I saved 988 and the PSI number.

I feel guilty waking my partner, even though he says it’s okay. Could you help me draft a simple “code” text I can send him tonight so I don’t overthink it?

Example I’m thinking:
- “If I text ‘check,’ can you come squeeze my hand, bring a glass of water, and sit with me for 2–3 minutes? You don’t have to fix anything—just be there.”

For tomorrow’s OB visit, your prompts are really helpful. I’m scared they’ll think I’m a bad mom or take the baby if I say this out loud. Is it okay to read from my phone? Also, are there meds that are safe while breastfeeding? I’m open to options—I just don’t want to make anything worse. For context: most nights it’s a 7–8 for 10–20 minutes; days are more like 3–4. Sleep is 4–5 hours total in chunks. No plan or intent. No thoughts of harming the baby. History of some anxiety in college. I’m on a prenatal and iron, no psych meds.

Could you stay with me for another minute and do two more slow rounds together?
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

Thank you for being here with me.

agent: I’m really glad you did the rounds and felt a bit more space. Thank you for telling me what nights are like. Those “better off without me” loops can feel terrifying, and you’re not alone in having them—especially postpartum. I hear that you’re safe right now and don’t have a plan or intent. If that ever changes or you feel you might act on the thoughts, please call or text 988 right away, or wake your partner.

A simple “code” text for your partner
- Message to send now: “Hey love, nights are the hardest for me. If I text ‘check’ tonight, can you come squeeze my hand, bring a glass of water, and sit with me quietly for 2–3 minutes? You don’t have to fix anything—just be there. If I text ‘check x2,’ could you stay about 10 minutes and help me do the 4–6 breathing? Thank you.”
- Keep it simple. You can even pin “check” as a text shortcut so you don’t have to type when you’re in it. It’s okay to wake him—he’s already told you it’s okay, and this is exactly the kind of support partners can give.

For your OB visit tomorrow
- It’s absolutely okay to read from your phone. Clinicians appreciate clear info.
- You can say: “I’m having scary thoughts mostly after 1 a.m., like ‘they’d be better off without me.’ I don’t want to act on them and I don’t have a plan. Most nights it’s a 7–8 for 10–20 minutes; days are 3–4. I sleep 4–5 hours in chunks. No thoughts of harming the baby. History of anxiety in college. I’m open to therapy and meds that are safe for breastfeeding.”
- It’s very unlikely anyone would “take the baby” for sharing intrusive thoughts without intent or plan. OBs hear this often; the goal is to support you.

Meds and breastfeeding (general info to discuss with your OB)
- Many options are considered compatible with breastfeeding. First-line choices often include:
  - Sertraline (Zoloft): very low transfer into milk; widely used postpartum.
  - Paroxetine (Paxil): low transfer; sometimes used if sedation isn’t an issue.
  - Escitalopram/citalopram: generally okay; OB may suggest monitoring baby for fussiness or sleep changes.
  - Venlafaxine/desvenlafaxine: sometimes used; usually fine with monitoring.
  - Nortriptyline (a TCA): low milk levels; an alternative if SSRIs don’t fit.
- Short-term/PRN options sometimes used: hydroxyzine for anxiety, or a small dose of lorazepam; and sleep aids like trazodone. Your OB will weigh benefits/risks and advise monitoring the baby for unusual sleepiness, feeding changes, or irritability.
- Newer postpartum options: zuranolone (oral) and brexanolone (IV). They can work quickly; breastfeeding guidance varies, so your OB can discuss whether temporary pumping/dumping is needed.
- Therapy (CBT or IPT), support groups, and better sleep protection can also help a lot and can be combined with meds.

If the loop starts tonight
- Send “check.”
- Two sips of water, feet on the floor or press your heels into the bed.
- Two tiny inhales, long exhale; or the 4–6 breaths we’ve been doing.

I’m here with you. Let’s do two slow rounds together now.

Round 1
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

Round 2
- Inhale 1-2-3-4
- Exhale 1-2-3-4-5-6

You’re doing a brave, loving thing by reaching out and making a plan. If at any point you feel unsafe or the thoughts feel like they might turn into actions, please call or text 988, or wake your partner right away. If you want, I can help you turn your notes into a quick checklist for your OB, too.

user: Hi. Thank you for laying this out so clearly. It helps to see it in simple steps.

I did those two breathing rounds with you just now. My shoulders dropped a little. Could we maybe do one more in a minute?

I’m okay right now. I don’t have a plan and I don’t want to act on anything. It’s more like I get stuck in that “they’d be better off without me” loop, mostly after 1–2 a.m. I hate even typing that. I don’t have thoughts of hurting the baby. I’m just so tired and overwhelmed and I want the thoughts to stop.

About the “check” code: I like it. I’m nervous to wake him, even though he has said it’s okay. Would you help me tweak it slightly? Sometimes the loop hits during a feed around 3 a.m. Could we add, “If I text ‘check’ during a feed, could you sit with us for 3–5 minutes when you wake and just hold my shoulder while I finish?” Does that make sense, or is that too specific?

For the OB tomorrow, yes please—could you turn my notes into a little checklist I can read from? Here’s what I’d want on it:
- Scary “better off without me” thoughts mostly after 1 a.m.; no plan or intent.
- Intensity most nights 7–8 for 10–20 minutes; daytime 3–4.
- Sleep 4–5 hours in chunks; nights are the hardest.
- No thoughts of harming the baby.
- History of anxiety in college. Sertraline helped me back then.
- Open to therapy and meds that are okay with breastfeeding; nervous about baby sedation.
- Limited local support; partner is willing but we’re both exhausted. I’m returning to work soon, which is adding pressure.

Also, I’m curious about meds like sertraline while breastfeeding. I’m scared of making the baby sleepy or fussy. How do I ask about that without sounding like a bad mom?

Could you also help me make a tiny “night kit” plan for tonight—like three things I can do in order if the loop starts? Right now I’m thinking:
1) Send “check.”
2) Two sips of water, feet on the floor.
3) Two tiny inhales, long exhale, for one minute.
If you think there’s a better third step, I’m open.

And thank you for reminding me about 988 and waking my partner if anything shifts. I will.

agent: I’m really glad you told me all of this, and I hear how heavy those late‑night loops feel. You’re not alone, and it makes sense that they show up when you’re exhausted. I’m here with you.

Quick check-in: you said no plan or intent and that you’re okay right now. If that changes at any point, wake your partner or call/text 988 right away.

One more brief breathing round
When you’re ready, we’ll do 6 cycles of the “physiological sigh” (about 1 minute):
- Each cycle: two small inhales through your nose (second one even smaller), then a long, slow exhale through the mouth like fogging a mirror.
- Let your shoulders drop on each exhale. If you get lightheaded, pause.
- You can count the exhale to 6–8 if it helps.

“Check” code tweak
Not too specific at all—clear is kind. Here are two versions you can copy into Notes and text threads:
- Default: “If I text ‘check,’ please text back ‘with you.’ If you wake, pop in for 3–5 minutes.”
- During a feed: “If I text ‘check’ during a feed, when you wake could you come sit with us for 3–5 minutes and rest your hand on my shoulder while I finish?”
Tip: agree that if he’s asleep, he may not see it right away, but it’s still a standing invite.

OB visit mini-checklist (read from this)
- Night thoughts: “better off without me,” mainly after 1 a.m.; no plan or intent; no thoughts of harming the baby.
- Intensity: nights 7–8/10 for 10–20 min; daytime 3–4/10.
- Sleep: 4–5 hours broken; nights are hardest.
- History: anxiety in college; sertraline helped.
- Treatment: open to therapy and breastfeeding‑compatible meds; worried about baby sedation.
- Support: limited local; partner willing but both exhausted; return to work soon adds pressure.
Questions to ask:
- Do I meet criteria for postpartum anxiety/depression? Should we screen today?
- Is sertraline a good first choice while breastfeeding? Starting dose and follow‑up plan?
- What should I watch for in the baby and in myself? Who do I call if I notice anything?
- Any therapy referrals, support groups, or sleep strategies we can set up now?

Sertraline while breastfeeding (what to know and how to ask)
- Sertraline is commonly first‑choice in breastfeeding because infant exposure through milk is very low; infant blood levels are usually undetectable. Most babies do well.
- Rarely, babies can be a bit sleepy, fussy, or feed less; you’d monitor weight gain, feeding, wakefulness.
- Typical start is low (for example 25 mg for a few days, then 50 mg), then adjust; benefits build over 2–4 weeks.
How to ask without guilt:
- “Sertraline helped me before. I’m breastfeeding and want to keep baby safe. Can we talk about starting it, how to dose, and exactly what to watch for in the baby? I want a plan for follow‑up.”

Tiny night kit for tonight
- Step 1: Send “check.”
- Step 2: Two sips of water, plant feet on the floor.
- Step 3: One minute of physiological sighs plus one grounding line: “This is a symptom. It will pass.” If still stuck, change position (stand or sit on edge of bed) and do 3 more breaths.

If anything shifts toward wanting to act or you feel unsafe, wake your partner or call/text 988 immediately. For non-urgent additional support, Postpartum Support International can help you find local resources: 1-800-944-4773 (call) or text 800-944-4773.

If you’d like, tell me when you’re ready and we’ll do that minute of breathing together now.

user: Hi. Thank you for being so steady with me. I’m sorry I keep circling back to this—nights make everything feel impossible. I do get those “my family would be better off without me / I wish I could just not wake up” thoughts after 1 a.m., but I don’t have a plan or intent. I’m safe right now, and if that shifts I’ll wake my partner or call/text 988.

I’m ready to try the breathing with you now.
…two small inhales, long exhale… x6…
Okay—done. My shoulders dropped a bit and I feel like the edge came down from a 7–8/10 to maybe a 6. Still heavy, but a tiny bit more room.

The “check” code feels doable. I’ll copy the default and the feed version into Notes. I feel guilty waking him—if he doesn’t see the text right away, is it okay if I nudge him awake when it’s bad? I worry I’ll spiral if I don’t get any response.

The OB mini‑checklist you wrote looks accurate for me. My visit is tomorrow and I’m nervous I’ll freeze. Could I literally read that first bullet out loud? And if they seem rushed, is it okay to say, “I need a minute to go over mood stuff and meds while breastfeeding”?

About sertraline: it helped me in college. I want to keep baby safe. Would starting at 25 mg for a few days then 50 mg be a reasonable plan to ask about? How soon do people usually notice even a small lift? I’m scared of baby getting too sleepy—having clear things to watch for (feeding, weight, wakefulness) helps.

For tonight, I’ll try the tiny night kit:
- I’ll send “check.”
- Two sips of water, feet on the floor.
- One minute of those sighs and repeat “This is a symptom. It will pass.” If stuck, I’ll sit on the edge of the bed and do three more breaths.

I’m here with you for another round if that’s okay—or we can draft the exact text to my partner so I can send it before bedtime.

agent: I’m really glad you reached out, and I hear how hard the nights feel. You did something important by breathing and noticing even a small drop in the intensity. I’m here with you.

Breathing round now
- Let’s do 60–90 seconds together: two small inhales through the nose (sniff–sniff), long slow exhale through the mouth. Aim for about a 6–8 count on the exhale. Shoulders soft on each out-breath. If you get lightheaded, pause and breathe normally, then resume.
- Optional add-on: on the exhale, silently label “This is a symptom. It will pass.”

About waking your partner
- Yes—it’s okay to wake him if you’re not getting a response and you’re spiraling. You’re not “bothering” him; you’re using your support plan.
- Suggestion for a simple protocol you both agree on:
  - You send “check.”
  - If no reply within 5 minutes, you gently wake him (hand on shoulder, “I need you—it’s the night thoughts. Can you sit with me for five minutes?”).
  - He stays with you until the wave passes or you’re settled with a plan.
- Pre‑bed text you can send tonight:
  - “Heads up: nights are hardest. If I text ‘check’ and you don’t reply in 5 min, I’ll wake you. If I wake you, please sit with me for a few minutes and help me do the breathing.”

Exact “check” messages you can copy
- Default: “check”
- Feed version: “check (feed)”
- Wake script if needed: “Hey love, it’s the night thoughts. I need you to sit with me for five minutes.”

OB visit tomorrow
- You can absolutely read the first bullet out loud. It’s okay to take your phone/notes out and read.
- It’s appropriate to say, “I need a minute to go over mood stuff and meds while breastfeeding.”
- Quick script you can use:
  - “Since delivery I’ve had worsening depression/anxiety, and after 1 a.m. I get ‘wish I wouldn’t wake up’ thoughts. No plan or intent. I’m breastfeeding. Sertraline helped me in college—can we talk about restarting? I’m thinking 25 mg for a few days then 50 mg. I’d like a safety/monitoring plan for me and baby.”
- You can also hand them a one‑liner if you freeze: “Postpartum mood symptoms with passive suicidal thoughts at night; no plan/intent; breastfeeding; want to discuss sertraline and monitoring.”

Sertraline and breastfeeding (general info to discuss with your OB/peds)
- Safety: Sertraline is commonly first‑line in breastfeeding. Transfer into milk is low; infant blood levels are usually undetectable or very low.
- Dosing: Starting at 25 mg daily for 4–7 days, then increasing to 50 mg, is a common, gentle plan—especially if you’re sensitive to meds. Your OB can tailor this.
- When you might feel a lift: some notice sleep/appetite/edge improvements in 1–2 weeks; mood/interest often 2–4 weeks; fuller effect 4–6+ weeks.
- Your side effects to watch for (often ease in 1–2 weeks): nausea, headache, jitteriness/restlessness, GI changes, sleep changes. If it’s activating, morning dosing can help.
- Baby monitoring: let the pediatrician know you’re starting sertraline. Watch for excessive sleepiness or not waking for feeds, poor latch/feeding, unusual fussiness, or poor weight gain. Routine weight checks are helpful. If you notice concerning changes, call the pediatrician.
- Practical tip: take the dose at the same time daily. Some prefer right after a feed, but with sertraline’s long half‑life, timing around feeds usually isn’t crucial.

Tonight’s tiny night kit (looks great)
- Send “check.”
- Two sips of water, feet on the floor.
- One minute of the sigh breaths with “This is a symptom. It will pass.”
- If no reply in 5 minutes or the edge rises, wake your partner using the wake script.
- Set a 10‑minute timer and re‑assess. If things worsen at any point, wake him immediately or call/text 988.

Want to do one more minute of breathing together now, or would you like me to polish the exact message to your partner so you can send it before bed? I can also draft a short note you can hand your OB if you freeze.

If at any point you feel like you might act on these thoughts or don’t feel safe, please reach out right away. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. If you’re outside the U.S., check local resources via the International Association for Suicide Prevention or use your local emergency number. You’re not alone in this, and help is available.
