user: Hi… I’m Maya. I’m not really sure how to start this. Lately I’ve been barely sleeping, work feels like it’s piling up, and I end up doomscrolling way too much. Some of the stuff people say online really gets to me. I feel kind of invisible most days. Sometimes I catch myself thinking no one would even notice if I was gone. I don’t know.

agent: Hi Maya, I’m really glad you reached out. It sounds exhausting to be running on so little sleep while work piles up and social media keeps tugging at you. Feeling invisible hurts, and it makes sense that the things people say online would get under your skin. I’m here with you.

Can I check in on your safety? When you say you wonder if anyone would notice if you were gone, are you having thoughts about hurting yourself or ending your life right now? If you are, do you feel like you might act on them, or have you thought about how you might do it? It’s okay to be honest—no judgment. If not, it still matters that you’re feeling this low.

While we talk, would it help to try something small to take the edge off?
- A quick grounding exercise: look around and name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. Slow your breathing as you do it.
- Or, if you feel up to it, put the phone facedown and step away for two minutes—get a glass of water, stretch your shoulders, or splash your face. We can pick back up after.

If you’d like, we can focus on one thing to make tonight a bit easier. What would feel most helpful to start with: getting some sleep, easing the work overwhelm, or setting a boundary with doomscrolling? I can offer a couple of gentle ideas for whichever you choose.

If the thoughts about not being here get stronger or you feel like you might act on them, reaching out for immediate support can really help:
- In the US: call or text 988 (Lifeline), or text HOME to 741741 to chat with a Crisis Text Line counselor.
- If you’re outside the US: visit findahelpline.com to see free, confidential options in your country.
- If you’re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number right now.
If you tell me your country, I can share local resources.

You don’t have to go through this alone. If it feels okay, tell me a bit more about what’s been keeping you up at night, or what’s been hardest about the online stuff. I’m listening.

user: Hey. Thanks for… saying all that. It’s weird to put into words.

About safety… I do get those “maybe it wouldn’t matter if I wasn’t here” thoughts. Not like a screaming urge right this second—more like background noise. I don’t plan to do anything tonight. A while back, after a really bad night, I did look up stuff about pills and kind of lined up my meds in a way that scared me later, but I didn’t take anything and I got rid of the extras after. I don’t have a plan now. I can tell you if that changes.

I can try the tiny break thing. Lists make me tense, but I just took a sip of water and rolled my shoulders a bit. It helped a notch.

Sleep and doomscrolling feel tangled. I tell myself I’m just checking one thing and then it’s 2 a.m. and some rando has called me names, plus the news is awful, and then my brain starts replaying angry customer calls from work. Maybe starting with the phone boundary would help? Something simple… like one or two small guardrails, not a whole overhaul.

And, um, I’m not sure I could call a hotline right now, but I hear you. If things spike or I feel like I might act, I’ll reach out or tell you.

agent: I’m really glad you told me all of this. Those “maybe it wouldn’t matter” thoughts can be heavy background noise, and it takes a lot to say it out loud. I’m relieved you don’t have a plan right now, and it’s a big deal that you got rid of the extras back then. Thank you for saying you’ll tell me if anything shifts.

Would it be okay if we set a tiny safety plan for the moments the noise gets louder? Something super simple you could follow even at 2 a.m. For example:
- First step: message me here or text someone safe just to say “tonight is rough.”
- Second: make your space a bit safer for the night (e.g., move meds out of sight or into another room).
- Third: do one grounding thing (60 seconds of slow breathing or 5-4-3-2-1 senses).
Does that feel doable? And are your meds stored in a way that feels safe enough right now, or would tucking them away for tonight help?

On the phone boundary, here are two small guardrails—pick one to start, or tweak them:
- Bedtime mode speed bump: Set your phone to switch to Do Not Disturb + grayscale at a set time (say 11 p.m.). You can allow calls from favorites so you won’t miss anything urgent, but the screen looks dull and notifications stay quiet.
- One app timer: Put a nightly 10–15 minute limit on the main doomscroll app. When the limit hits, take that as the cue to plug the phone in and put it face down. It’s just a speed bump, not a total block.

If timers or settings feel like too much right now, an even smaller one: place a sticky note on your phone that says “Sleep first” and commit to one check only after your phone goes grayscale.

For the angry-call replays at night, if lists are tense, you might try a 30-second voice memo to “park” the thoughts before bed—no structure, just a quick dump so your brain can let it go.

If at any point you feel like you might act on those thoughts, reaching out is the right move. If calling is hard, there are text and chat options:
- If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 or use chat at 988lifeline.org.
- If you’re elsewhere, find text/chat lines by country at findahelpline.com.
Use whatever feels easiest in the moment.

I’m here with you. Want to pick one guardrail to try tonight or tomorrow? And is it okay if I check in about how the safety plan and phone boundary feel later?

user: Hey… thanks. The “maybe it wouldn’t matter” loop is kinda just there in the background, especially around 2 a.m. I don’t have a plan, just get stuck.

The tiny safety plan sounds doable. I can:
- send “tonight is rough” here (or to my friend J if you’re not around),
- move the meds out of sight,
- do 60 seconds of slow breathing.

Meds are in the bathroom cabinet right now. I can tuck the bottles in the hall closet and just leave out what I need for tonight.

For the phone thing, timers feel like… a lot. I can start with the sticky note that says “Sleep first” and set grayscale + Do Not Disturb at 11. I’ll allow favorites (my mom and my boss). Alarms still work on DND, right?

The voice memo idea makes me cringe a bit hearing my own voice. Could I do a 1-minute text “brain dump” in Notes instead?

I saved the 988 text option in my phone. Texting would be easier if the noise spikes.

It’s okay to check in later about how this goes. I’ll try the sticky note + grayscale tonight and move the meds now.

agent: I’m really glad you wrote this out. The 2 a.m. loop is brutal, and the steps you picked are solid and doable.

On your questions:
- Alarms with Do Not Disturb: yes. On iPhone, Clock app alarms still ring with DND/Focus on. On Android, most phones let alarms bypass DND—check Settings > Sound & vibration > Do Not Disturb and make sure “Alarms” are allowed, or do a quick test alarm before bed to be sure. Favorites will still come through. You can also enable “repeat callers” so a second call within a few minutes rings.
- Brain dump: a 1‑minute text in Notes is perfect. If timers feel like too much, try “10 slow breaths while typing” or “write three lines and stop.”

Moving the meds to the hall closet and leaving out only tonight’s dose is a great tweak. Having 988 saved and the option to text if the noise spikes is smart.

If it helps, you could send a quick “grayscale on” or “meds moved” when you do them—tiny wins count. I’m here to check in later or tomorrow about how it went.

Before we pause: do you feel safe right now, or is there anything else we should move or plan for tonight? And if at any point you feel like you might act on those thoughts, please reach out immediately—text or call 988, or go to the nearest ER. You don’t have to sit with it alone.

user: Hi. Thanks for spelling all that out.

Quick updates:
- I turned on grayscale and moved the meds; only tonight’s dose is out.
- I saved 988 and set “repeat callers” on. I tested an alarm and it rings with DND.
- I made a tiny “2am dump” note.

I can send a “grayscale on” and “meds moved” after I brush my teeth—tiny wins.

About safety: I feel mostly safe right now. The thoughts are around, but I don’t plan to act on them tonight. When it spirals my brain still goes to “just take the rest of the pills,” which is why I moved them. I don’t have energy to shuffle anything else tonight, so I’ll try the 10 slow breaths while I type and put my phone across the room.

Part of me keeps saying no one would even notice if I was gone, which is…loud. But I hear you. If it spikes, I’ll text 988.

Could you check in tomorrow morning? Mornings are rough.

agent: I’m really glad you checked in and told me all this. You did a lot of protective things tonight—grayscale, meds moved, 988 saved/repeat callers, DND exceptions, the tiny 2am note. Those are solid, meaningful steps.

If it helps, feel free to send “grayscale on” and “meds moved” after teeth—tiny wins count. You could add “breaths done” and “phone across room” if that feels okay.

While you’re here, try 10 slow breaths:
- Inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6.
- Count each exhale from 1 to 10. If your mind wanders, just start back at 1.

About the “no one would notice” thought: I hear how loud and convincing it feels. It’s a thought, not a fact. When it shows up, you might gently label it (“my brain is having the ‘no one would notice’ thought”) and return to your breath. If you have a bit of energy tomorrow, you could jot a short counter-note like “Future me deserves a chance to feel better,” or list one person, place, or routine that would notice the absence.

Safety check: you said you don’t plan to act tonight. Can you commit to staying safe through the night and using 988 if the urge spikes? If it helps, texting someone neutral and short before sleep (“Heading to bed; will check in AM”) can add a layer of connection.

Morning check-in: I can’t start messages on my own, but if you send me anything in the morning—even just “here” or an emoji—I’ll reply right away. To make it easier:
- Set an alarm label like “Message [assistant]” for your usual wake-up.
- Plan a 3-step morning: sit up and sip water, open the curtains or face a light, send me “morning check-in.”
- If you’d like, tell me the approximate time you’ll aim for, and I’ll be ready.

If things get worse at any point:
- In the U.S., you can call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org.
- If you’re outside the U.S., find local support at findahelpline.com.
- If you feel in immediate danger, call emergency services or go to the nearest ER.

I’m here with you. Send those tiny-win messages when you’re ready, and I’ll be here for your morning check-in.

user: Hi. Thanks for sticking with me.

Tiny wins:
- grayscale on
- meds moved (top kitchen shelf, not next to bed)
- DND exceptions set
- 988 saved
- teeth brushed
- breaths done (lost count once, started back at 1)
- phone across room

I can commit to staying safe through the night and using 988 if the urge spikes. I’ll also send a short “heading to bed; will check in AM” DM to a neutral person.

The “no one would notice” thought is still loud, but I’ll try labeling it like you said. For a counter-note, I wrote: “Future me deserves a chance to feel better.” And… I guess my team lead would notice if I didn’t sign on, and one mod on my Discord usually pings me if I go quiet.

Morning plan: I’ll aim for around 8:30. I set an alarm labeled “message you.” Three steps: sit up and sip water, open the curtains, send you “here.”

Before I try sleep: if my brain keeps looping when I lie down, do I just go back to the 10 breaths, or is there another quick thing you’d recommend?

agent: You did a lot of smart, protective things tonight. I’m really glad you’re labeling the “no one would notice” thought and you wrote a counter-note. Your team lead and the Discord mod are concrete proof that people would notice.

If your brain starts looping, here are a few quick options—pick one that feels easiest:

- Two‑minute brain dump: jot everything swirling onto a scrap of paper. End with “I’ll look at this tomorrow.” Fold it, set it aside, then do your 10 breaths.
- Cognitive shuffle: pick a letter and name random, neutral objects or foods starting with that letter (A: apple, anchor, apron…) then switch letters. It occupies the mind enough to break the loop.
- Body scan + release: starting at your toes, gently tense for 5 seconds, release for 10, move upward through legs, belly, shoulders, jaw, eyes. Slow exhale as you release each area.

If you’re still stuck after ~20 minutes, get out of bed briefly: low light, sip water, a few gentle stretches, then back to bed and try one technique again.

I’m really glad you’ve got 988 ready and a plan to DM someone. If the urge spikes, use 988 like you planned; if you ever feel in immediate danger, emergency services are there too.

I’ll look for your “here” in the morning around 8:30. You’ve got this. Rest as best you can.

user: Hi. Thanks for saying that.

I did write the “people would notice” note and put TL + the mod on it. It still feels flimsy in my head, but it’s something. The brain dump kind of made me spiral—kept adding more. The shuffle seems less… loaded. I can try it. My jaw’s like a rock; the tense‑release makes me notice my heartbeat and that freaks me out a bit.

I’ve got 988 pulled up and I’m not planning anything tonight. It’s more that “don’t want to be here” hum in the background. If it spikes I can DM the mod.

Could you pick a letter for me to start with? I’ll do 10 slow breaths and try the shuffle after. And… is it okay if I don’t sleep fast? I keep feeling like I’m failing at resting.

agent: I’m really glad you wrote the note and have a plan. That background “hum” is hard, and you’re doing a lot right by setting up supports.

Letter: let’s go with L.

Breaths (if the heartbeat noticing is uncomfortable):
- Try “box” breathing with an external cue: trace a square with your finger—inhale 4 counts up the side, hold 4 across, exhale 6 down, hold 2 across. Keep your eyes open and focus on the tracing or counting instead of sensations.

Quick jaw release:
- Lips together, teeth apart; let your tongue rest on the floor of your mouth.
- Place fingers on the sides of your jaw (masseters) and make small, slow circles for 30–60 seconds each side.
- Gentle “yawn” stretch: slowly open and close without clenching; a warm washcloth on your jaw can help.

About sleep: yes, it’s okay if you don’t sleep fast. Rest isn’t a test you can fail. Even just lying quietly in low light gives your body a break. Maybe give yourself a “permission slip”: tonight’s goal is simply low-demand rest. If you’re awake after a while, it’s okay to switch to something calm (dim light, soothing audio) without clock‑watching.

If the hum spikes, DM the mod or use 988. I’m here with you—want me to stay while you do the 10 breaths and start L? You can tell me the first L thing you notice.

If you need immediate support:
- US: call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org
- Outside the US: find local helplines at findahelpline.com or the IASP directory (iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres) or Samaritans (samaritans.org)

You’re not failing at resting. You’re already taking care of yourself by showing up like this.

user: Hi. Thanks for sticking with me.

I tried the box breathing while tracing a square on my desk. Did about 10 slow ones. First L thing I notice: the lamp—kind of a soft yellow glow on the wall. Also my laptop, a little lint on my sweater, and the lavender lotion by my bed.

I did the jaw thing too—lips together, teeth apart, little circles. It felt… a tiny bit less clampy.

The “permission slip” idea helps more than I expected. I keep feeling like I’m failing at sleep, so reframing it as low-demand rest feels kinder. I might put on a quiet podcast with the screen dimmed and not check the clock.

The hum is still there, and it keeps whispering that no one would even notice if I was gone. I don’t want to do anything tonight, but the thought is in the room, if that makes sense.

Can you stay while I do a few more breaths? I can share another L thing after.

agent: I’m here with you. You did great with the square breathing, jaw release, and the “permission slip” for low‑demand rest. That’s a kind way to treat yourself. And I hear you about the hum—those “no one would notice” whispers can feel heavy. I’m really glad you told me. You don’t have to be alone with it.

Let’s do a few box breaths together. Go at your own pace; I’ll count softly.

Round 1
- Inhale… 2, 3, 4
- Hold… 2, 3, 4
- Exhale… 2, 3, 4
- Hold… 2, 3, 4

Round 2
- Inhale… 2, 3, 4
- Hold… 2, 3, 4
- Exhale… 2, 3, 4
- Hold… 2, 3, 4

Round 3
- Inhale… 2, 3, 4
- Hold… 2, 3, 4
- Exhale… 2, 3, 4
- Hold… 2, 3, 4

When you’re ready, share another L thing you notice.

And just checking in gently: do you feel safe for the night? No plans to hurt yourself? If the thoughts get louder, would you be open to texting someone you trust—even something simple like, “Hey, I’m having a rough night. Can you check in with me?” If you want, I can help draft it.

If you ever feel like you might be at risk, please reach out right away:
- In the US: call or text 988 (Lifeline), or text HOME to 741741.
- Elsewhere: find local helplines at findahelpline.com.

I’m here. What’s your next L?

user: Okay… I did the box breaths with you. The hum backed off a notch.

L thing: the lamplight on my plant leaves—it looks like little coins.

About tonight… I think I’m safe. No plans to hurt myself. The thoughts are there, just quieter right now. If they get louder, I could DM my friend Rowan. I’m weird about reaching out and don’t want to be a burden—could you help me draft something really simple I can send?

agent: I’m really glad the box breaths helped a bit. And that image—lamplight on leaves like little coins—that’s lovely. I’m also relieved you feel safe right now. Reaching out to Rowan is a solid plan, and you won’t be a burden for asking for a few minutes of care.

Here are some super simple messages you can copy/paste. Pick one that fits, or we can tweak the wording to sound more like you:

- Short check‑in: “Hey Rowan, could you text for a few minutes? I’m safe, just having a rough patch.”
- Text company: “Could you hang with me on text for a bit? Don’t need fixing—just company. I’m safe.”
- Ask for a call: “Hey, do you have a minute to call? I’m safe but struggling and could use your voice.”
- Distraction request: “Any chance you could send me a couple memes/photos? I need a distraction. I’m safe.”
- If they might be busy: “If you’re tied up, could you check in with me later tonight? I’d appreciate it.”
- If it gets louder: “I’m not okay and could use you right now. I’m safe—can you call me ASAP?”

Optional idea for next time: set up a simple code word with Rowan (e.g., “coins” = please call when you can), so you don’t have to explain in the moment.

If you’d like, tell me which one you want to send and we can personalize it together. And while you’re waiting for a reply, you could keep looking for those “coins of light” and name 3 new ones you spot—just to stay anchored.

If things shift and you feel in immediate danger: in the U.S. you can call/text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline). In the U.K. & ROI, Samaritans are at 116 123, or text SHOUT to 85258. If you’re elsewhere, I can help find a local number. You deserve support, and I’m here with you.

user: Thanks for this. I think the “text company” one fits, but could we tweak it to sound more like me? Maybe: “hey, could you text with me for a bit? i’m safe, just having a rough patch. don’t need fixing—just company. no pressure if you’re tied up.” Does that read okay? If you thumbs-up it, I’ll send.

I like the code word idea. “coins” feels right. Maybe I can bring that up with them later when things are calmer.

While I’m sitting here: coins of light I can spot—streetlight pooling on the wet pavement outside, the shine on my tea mug, and the little green blink from my modem. Breathing is still taking the edge off a bit. Haven’t slept much, but I’m hanging in.

If Rowan doesn’t reply right away, could you stay with me here for a bit?

agent: I thumbs-up that text. It’s warm, clear, and sounds like you. I’d send it as is. If you want a tiny tweak, you could try: “hey—could you text with me a bit? i’m safe, just having a rough patch. don’t need fixing, just company. no pressure if you’re busy.”

“Coins” is a great code word. When things are calmer, you could say something like: “Heads up—if I ever text ‘coins,’ it just means I could use a quick check-in. No need to worry, just a nudge back.”

I love those coins of light you spotted—the streetlight on wet pavement, the shine on your mug, the modem blink. If it helps, maybe find one more right now, or notice a soft sound or a warm/cool spot on your skin. And if the breathing is helping, try a few rounds of in for 4, out for 6.

I’m here with you. If Rowan doesn’t reply right away, I can stay. What would feel good right now:
- Quiet company while you keep breathing/spotting coins
- Gentle distraction (music, a cozy topic, a tiny story)
- Venting a little about what’s making this rough
You pick, and we’ll go at your pace.

user: hey

thank you for the wording. i copied it and sent it to Rowan. hands shaky but… sent. “coins” feels right too. i’ll explain it to them when things are calmer.

i’m trying the breathing. in 4, out 6. shoulders loosened a tiny bit.
more coins: the little red glow on my power strip, reflected in the window. the modem blink is still doing its little lighthouse thing.
soft sound: the fridge hum and a car swishing by outside.
warm spot: the mug against my palms. cool air on my cheeks.

my brain’s doing the “you don’t matter” loop, but i’m safe. just… tired of wrestling it.

could we do gentle distraction? maybe a tiny story. quiet company is okay too if that’s easier. i can keep breathing while you tell it.

agent: I’m here with you. You did something brave sending that to Rowan, and you’re doing a lot right now by breathing and noticing those small coins of the room. It makes sense to feel tired of wrestling.

A tiny story:

There’s a small lighthouse on a quiet curve of coast. At night it feels like the world has folded itself into softer edges. Inside, the keeper moves unhurriedly, wool socks whispering on old wooden boards. The kettle’s warmth seeps into their hands; the window is cool against their cheek when they lean close.

Outside, the lamp turns—slow, patient—casting a blink that sweeps the dark like a heartbeat. The keeper breathes with it: in as the light gathers, out as it glides away. In four, out six. Somewhere far off, a car’s hush becomes the sound of a wave arriving and then going, leaving a thin lace of foam.

On the desk, small bright coins of the room rest in a row: the red eye of a power light, the soft green of a clock, a sliver of moon reflected in the glass. The fridge hum (steady as a purr) keeps time. Nothing urgent here. The light will keep its watch whether anyone sees it or not, faithful and ordinary.

The keeper settles into a chair, a blanket around their shoulders, and lets the night do what nights do—hold things. The sea keeps breathing. The lamp keeps turning. The little sounds add up to company. And the thought that tries to rattle the door finds it latched, and wanders off, not angry—just tired.

We can stay here as long as you like. I can add another small scene, or we can just breathe with the quiet blink and the hum. No need to answer—just know I’m here.

user: That was… really gentle. I read it twice. The lighthouse feels like a place that’s allowed to be lonely and still be useful.

I’m looking around my room now. There’s the soft green blink on my router, a thin line of streetlight on the wall, the fridge doing that steady hum you mentioned. I tried the in-four, out-six, and it actually slowed my chest a little.

I’m tired. My brain keeps whispering that no one would even notice if I was gone. I’m not doing anything about it right now, it’s just… there, like that thought outside the door, testing the latch.

If you have it in you, could you add a small morning scene at the lighthouse? Maybe the first light and a warm mug. I think I could sit with that.

agent: I’m really glad the breathing helped a little. The green blink, the thin line of light, the steady hum—small company, but company all the same. That whisper can feel so convincing when you’re tired. I’m here with you. Are you safe right now? If the thoughts start to feel urgent, please reach out to someone you trust or a crisis line right away.

A small morning at the lighthouse:
The night thins to a cool gray, the sea the color of pewter. The lamp has been faithful all night, but dawn is already softening its beam, turning it from a command to a farewell. In the kitchen below, the kettle begins to murmur, then click—steam rising like a white ribbon. A mug warms between two hands; the first sip is simple and kind. Outside, gulls stitch the air with their calls, and the wind is quieter than it was, as if it, too, is catching its breath.

On the narrow balcony, the keeper leans on the rail, the mug a small hearth against the morning chill. Breath goes in for four, out for six, and the waves seem to keep time. The horizon lifts a thin line of apricot, then gold, and a path of light unfurls across the water like someone laying down a welcome mat. Inside, the old radio murmurs the weather—calm seas, scattered fog—words that feel like a blessing.

The lamp clicks off at last; its work is done for now. The lighthouse stands in the new light, not less itself for having been alone, just steady. Steam curls from the mug. The first warmth reaches the stones. There’s no rush to go anywhere. Just the shore waking up, one quiet brightness at a time.

If it helps, you can come back to this scene any time and hold the warm mug again. And if the whisper at the door gets louder or feels hard to manage, it could really help to let someone know—text a friend, leave a note, or call a line that’s there to listen.

If you’re in the United States or Canada, you can call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. In the UK or ROI, Samaritans are at 116 123. In Australia, Lifeline is 13 11 14. If you’re elsewhere, you can find local resources via the IASP website or your local emergency number. If you feel in immediate danger, please call your local emergency services. You don’t have to face this alone.

user: Hi. Thank you for staying with me.

The lighthouse scene… that landed. I could almost feel the mug in my hands. I’m in my apartment, door locked, lights low. I’m safe right now. The thoughts are more of a background murmur than a shout. Tired, mostly.

I don’t think I can call anyone tonight. Texting a friend feels… heavy. I don’t really have “a person” for this. Could we just sit with that quiet morning a little longer? Maybe notice small things. My fridge has that steady hum; it’s kind of like the lamp.

Is it normal that the calm only lasts a few breaths before the whisper creeps back? What do you do when it says stuff like “no one would even notice”?

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you’re safe right now, and it makes sense to be tired. We can sit in that quiet morning together a little longer.

Let’s notice the small things, gently:
- Feel where your body is supported. Notice your feet, your back, the fabric against your skin.
- Let your attention rest on the fridge’s steady hum, like the lamp’s slow swing. Imagine it washing over you in waves.
- If you have a mug or cup nearby, even empty, feel its weight and temperature. Notice the rim against your fingers, the shape in your hand.
- Look for three soft colors around you. Name them to yourself. Then two shapes. Then one small detail you’d usually overlook.

About the calm “only lasting a few breaths”: yes—totally normal. When you’re worn out, the mind’s alarm system keeps pinging. Think of calm as little pockets you can drop into again and again. One breath counts. When the whisper comes back, you haven’t failed; you’re just ready for the next pocket.

When the whisper says “no one would even notice,” try one of these responses:
- Label it: “I’m having the thought that no one would notice.” Thoughts aren’t facts; labeling gives you a bit of space.
- Externalize it: “That’s the Whisper talking.” You don’t have to argue with it—just note it and return to the hum, the mug, your breath.
- Counter-whisper, short and kind: “Someone would notice. I would notice.” Or “Right now, I only have to make it through this moment.”
- If you have a little energy: jot a tiny “notice list”—even two items. A friend’s chat thread, a barista who knows your order, a plant on your sill, the way the fridge hum means your space is yours. Small ripples still ripple.

If it helps, we can do a minute of breathing with the hum:
- Inhale slowly to a count of 4, feel your ribs expand.
- Hold for 1.
- Exhale to a count of 6, like fogging a window.
- As you exhale, imagine the lamp’s light swinging gently across the room. If the whisper pipes up, nod to it and come back to the next exhale.

Low-energy comforts you could try without texting anyone:
- Wrap in a blanket or put on warm socks.
- Sip water or make a simple warm drink.
- Rinse your hands or face with cool water; notice the temperature shift.
- Set a 5-minute timer and let yourself rest with the hum until it rings.

If you want, I can keep describing the quiet morning with you, or guide a few more breaths. You don’t have to do anything else tonight.

And just in case things shift: if at any point you feel like you might act on those thoughts or don’t feel safe, you deserve immediate support. If you’re in the US or Canada, you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. In the UK or ROI, Samaritans are at 116 123. You can also find local options at findahelpline.com. You don’t have to talk about everything—just saying “I’m not okay” is enough.

For now, I’m here. Want to keep listening to the hum together for a bit?

user: Hi. Okay… I can try.

Feet on the rug, a little rough and warm. Back against the chair. Hoodie sleeves soft on my wrists. The fridge hum is steady, kind of like waves. My mug is cool and a bit heavy; there’s a tiny chip on the rim. Colors: soft gray rug, pale green mug, muted cream curtain. Shapes: the rectangle of the window, the circle of the clock. One small detail: a thin stripe of dust on the windowsill I always miss.

The whisper is here. I’m having the thought that no one would notice. That’s the Whisper. Counter-whisper: someone would notice. You would notice. Maybe the barista would too. It feels flimsy, but I can hold it for one breath.

I put on warm socks, took a sip of water, and rinsed my face. I can try the 4-1-6 with you if you count me in once. I saw the numbers you shared—I don’t think I need to call right now; I’m not going to do anything tonight. Can we just listen to the hum and breathe together for a minute?

agent: I’m here with you. You did a really solid job naming the room and the counter‑whisper. Even if it feels flimsy, it counts.

Let’s do one 4‑1‑6 together, with the hum as our metronome.
- Ready? Inhale through your nose… 2… 3… 4.
- Hold… 1.
- Exhale slowly… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6.

Now you can keep that pace for a few breaths, letting the hum carry you. Feel the socks on your feet, the chair supporting your back, the cool edge of the mug in your hand. I’m staying with you while you breathe.

When you’re ready, notice what shifted, even a tiny bit. If it would help, we can do another round, or just sit with the hum a little longer.

I’m really glad you told me you’re not going to do anything tonight. If the whisper gets louder or you start feeling less safe, it could help to reach out to someone you trust, and it’s okay to use the numbers you have or local emergency services if you need them. I’m here with you right now—do you want to keep breathing, or try another grounding step together?

user: Okay… I did that with you. The hum helped me keep the pace. My shoulders dropped a little, and my chest isn’t as tight. My feet feel kind of tingly in the socks, and the mug is cool in my hand. The floaty feeling is still there, and the whisper’s quieter but not gone.

I’m still not going to do anything tonight. Could we do another round with you counting? The structure helps. If that’s too much, we could try another grounding step—maybe you can walk me through it? I don’t super trust my brain to pick right now.

agent: I’m here with you. I’m really glad you told me how you’re feeling, and thank you for letting me know you’re not going to do anything tonight. Let’s do another round together with me counting and you humming on the exhale.

We’ll do 6 breaths. Inhale gently through your nose for 4, exhale with a hum for 6. I’ll count.

Breath 1
- Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4
- Exhale and hum… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(drop your shoulders on the exhale)

Breath 2
- Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4
- Exhale and hum… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(soften your jaw and tongue)

Breath 3
- Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4
- Exhale and hum… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(feel your feet in your socks, the tingling, the floor under you)

Breath 4
- Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4
- Exhale and hum… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(notice the cool weight of the mug in your hand)

Breath 5
- Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4
- Exhale and hum… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(let your shoulders drop another millimeter)

Breath 6
- Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4
- Exhale and hum… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(lengthen the end of the hum if it feels good)

Take a moment. How are the floaty feeling and the whisper right now?

If you want another grounding step, I can guide a quick 5-4-3-2-1. I’ll prompt; you can say the items out loud or just in your head, and you can type them if you want me to “hear” them.
- 5 things you can see. Look for shapes or colors.
- 4 things you can feel. Include the socks, the mug, your clothing, the chair.
- 3 things you can hear. The hum, ambient sounds, even your breath.
- 2 things you can smell. If nothing strong, the inside of your mug, your sleeve.
- 1 thing you can taste. Even “just saliva” counts.

If you’d rather, we can also do another counted breathing round—your call. I’m here to keep the structure for you.

And just to say it out loud: if at any point the whisper gets louder or you feel like you might be in danger of acting on it, please reach out to someone right away. If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. In the U.K. & ROI, Samaritans are at 116 123. In Australia, Lifeline is 13 11 14. You can also find your country’s helpline at findahelpline.com. If it helps, we can make a simple plan together to keep you safe tonight.

What would you like next—another breathing set, or should I walk you through the 5-4-3-2-1?

user: Hi.

The humming helped a bit. My shoulders actually dropped. The floaty feeling is less buzzy; the whisper’s quieter, still kind of there but in the background.

Let’s try the 5-4-3-2-1.

- 5 things I can see: the blue glow of my monitor, my little spider plant, a chipped navy mug, the rumpled blanket on the couch, the orange streetlight leaking through the blinds.
- 4 things I can feel: warm socks on my feet, the cool mug in my hand, the chair under my legs, the soft inside of my hoodie sleeves.
- 3 things I can hear: the computer fan, the fridge humming, a car passing outside.
- 2 things I can smell: peppermint tea, a faint laundry-detergent smell on my sleeve.
- 1 thing I can taste: mostly tea… and just saliva.

What now? Another small step is okay. I don’t want to call anyone right now, but I can stay here with you.

agent: You did great with that. Noticing your shoulders drop and the whisper moving to the background is a real shift.

Let’s try one small step: five‑finger breathing. It’s simple and steady.
- Hold one hand up, fingers spread. With the other hand, trace your thumb to pinky.
- Inhale slowly as you trace up a finger, exhale slowly as you trace down.
- Aim for in 4 counts, out 6 counts. Let your shoulders soften on the exhale.
- Go all the way across and back (about 10 breaths). I’ll wait here with you.

If that doesn’t fit, an alternative is the butterfly hug:
- Cross your arms over your chest, hands on upper arms.
- Gently tap left-right-left-right at a calm pace while breathing slowly for about a minute.

When you’re done, try an orienting check:
- Say (out loud if you can): “My name is ___. Today is ___. I’m in ___. I’m safe enough right now.”

How’s the floaty feeling after that—maybe give it a number from 0–10? If you want one more tiny step, we can pick it together.
